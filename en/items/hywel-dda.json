The local health board of south-west Wales, covering an area roughly corresponding to the kingdoms of Dyfed and Seisyllwg of which Hywel was King, also bears his name.\r\n\r\n== Early life ==\nHywel was the son of King Cadell ap Rhodri of Seisyllwg. He had a brother, Clydog ap Cadell, who was probably the younger of the two. Hywel was later reputed to have married Elen ferch Llywarch , the supposed heiress of King Llywarch ap Hyfaidd of Dyfed, which connection was subsequently used to justify his family\u0027s reign over that kingdom.\nHywel\u0027s father Cadell had been installed as King of Seisyllwg by his father, Rhodri Mawr of Gwynedd, following the drowning of the last king in the traditional line, Gwgon, in 872. After Gwgon\u0027s death, Rhodri, husband to the dead king\u0027s sister Angharad, became steward of his kingdom. This gave Rhodri no standing to claim the kingship of Seisyllwg himself, but he was able to install his son Cadell as a subject king. Cadell died around 911, and his lands in Seisyllwg appear to have been divided between his two sons Hywel and Clydog.\r\n\r\n== Reign ==\nHywel probably already controlled Dyfed by the time he assumed his father\u0027s lands in Ceredigion. No king is recorded after the death of Llywarch in 904, and Hywel\u0027s marriage to Llywarch\u0027s only surviving heir probably ensured that the kingdom came into his hands. Hywel and Clydog seem to have ruled Seisyllwg together following their father\u0027s death and jointly submitted to Edward the Elder of England in 918. However, Clydog died in 920, evidently leaving the whole realm to Hywel. Hywel soon joined Seisyllwg and Dyfed into a single realm known as Deheubarth. This became the first significant event of his reign.\nDuring the year 928 Hywel made a pilgrimage to Rome, becoming the first Welsh prince to undertake such a trip and return, Hywel\u0027s wife Elen , the daughter of Llywarch , and granddaughter of King Hyfaidd of the Kingdom of Dyfed, died the same year. Upon his return he forged very close relations with \u00C6thelstan of England. From the outset \u00C6thelstan\u0027s intention was to secure the submission of all other kings in Britain; unusually, Hywel embraced submission to England and used it to his advantage whenever possible. In 934, Hywel supported \u00C6thelstan\u0027s invasion of Scotland. Later in his reign, he was able to leverage his close association with \u00C6thelstan and the English crown to great effect in his ambitions within Wales.\nIn 942 Hywel\u0027s cousin Idwal Foel, King of Gwynedd, determined to cast off English overlordship and took up arms against the new English king, Edmund. Idwal and his brother Elisedd were both killed in battle in 942 against Edmund\u0027s forces. By normal custom Idwal\u0027s crown should have passed to his sons, but Hywel intervened. He sent Iago and Ieuaf into exile and established himself as ruler over Gwynedd, which also probably placed him in control of the Kingdom of Powys, which was under the authority of Gwynedd. As such Hywel became king of nearly all of Wales except for Morgannwg and Gwent in the south.\nA single coin in Hywel\u0027s name is known. It was produced by the Chester moneyer Gillys in about 946. As there is only one, it is unlikely that it is the sole survivor of a Welsh coinage and it was probably produced as a gesture by the English to the Welsh king.\r\n\r\n== Legacy ==\n\nFollowing Hywel\u0027s death in 949 or 950, his kingdom was soon split into three. Gwynedd was reclaimed by the sons of Idwal Foel, Iago and Ieuaf, while Deheubarth was divided between Hywel\u0027s sons.\nHywel\u0027s name is associated with the laws of medieval Wales, which are commonly known as the Laws of Hywel Dda . None of the law manuscripts can be dated to Hywel\u0027s time, but Hywel\u0027s name is mentioned in the prologues to the laws, and are also known as the Code of Dyfed. These describe how Hywel gathered expert lawyers and priests from each commote in Wales together in the White Land in Dyfed in order to revise and codify the Laws of Wales. The story in the prologues lengthens with time, with more details in the later versions of the prologue. It seems highly unlikely that this meeting actually took place, with the purpose of the prologues being to emphasise the royal and Christian origin and background to the laws, and that in the face of criticism of the laws from outside Wales especially during John Peckham\u0027s period as Archbishop of Canterbury. Nevertheless, his name continued to be associated with Welsh law which remained in active use throughout Wales until the appointed date of implementation of the Laws in Wales Acts 1535\u20131542 of King Henry VIII of England who asserted his royal descent by blood-line from Rhodri Mawr via Hywel Dda.\nOpinions vary as to the motives for Hywel\u0027s close association with the court of \u00C6thelstan. J. E. Lloyd claimed Hywel was an admirer of Wessex, while David Peter Kirby suggests that it may have been the action of a pragmatist who recognised the realities of power in mid-10th century Britain.\nA Welsh-language poem entitled Armes Prydein, considered by Sir Ifor Williams to have been written in Deheubarth during Hywel\u0027s reign, called for the Welsh to join a confederation of all the non-English peoples of Britain and Ireland to fight the Saxons. The poem may be linked to the alliance of Norse and Celtic kingdoms which challenged \u00C6thelstan at the Battle of Brunanburh in 937. No Welsh forces joined this alliance, and this may well have been because of the influence of Hywel. On the other hand, neither did he send troops to support \u00C6thelstan.\r\n\r\n== Children ==\nHywel and Elen had the following children:\n\nOwain;\nRhodri;\nEdwin;\nAngharad.",
