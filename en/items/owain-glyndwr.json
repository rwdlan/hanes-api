In William Shakespeare\u0027s play Henry IV, Part 1 he appears as the character Owen Glendower as a king rather than a prince.\r\n\r\n== Early life and marriage ==\n\nOwain ap Gruffydd was born during 1354 in Sycharth, North East Wales, into a powerful Anglo-Welsh gentry family. His father, Gruffydd Fychan II had a claim to be hereditary Prince of Powys Fadog and was the Baron of Glyndyfrdwy and Lord of Cynllaith Owain, who died around 1370, leaving Glynd\u0175r\u0027s mother Elen ferch Tomas ap Llywelyn, a woman with an accent from Ceredigion , a widow when he was still a boy. Owain Glynd\u0175r was a descendant of all three Welsh Royal Principalities . Through his father, he was the heir of the former Kingdom of Powys . And through his mother, he was the direct descendant and heir of both Deheubarth and Gwynedd . He may also have been a descendant of the English King Edward I, through his granddaughter Eleanor. However, the existence of Eleanor is disputed.\nThe young Owain ap Gruffydd was possibly fostered at the home of David Hanmer, a rising lawyer shortly to be a justice of the King\u0027s Bench, or at the home of Richard FitzAlan, 3rd Earl of Arundel. Owain is then thought to have been sent to London to study law at the Inns of Court, as a student in Westminster, London, for over a period of seven years. He was possibly in London during the Peasants\u0027 Revolt of 1381. By 1384, he was living in Wales and married to David\u0027s daughter, Margaret Hanmer; their marriage took place, perhaps in 1383, in St Chad\u0027s Church, Hanmer in north-east Wales. Although other sources state that they were married in the 1370s. They started a large family and Owain established himself as the squire of his ancestral lands at Sycharth and Glyndyfrdwy.\n\n\n=== Military service ===\nGlynd\u0175r joined the king\u0027s military service in 1384 when he undertook garrison duty under the Welshman Sir Gregory Sais on the English\u2013Scottish border at Berwick-upon-Tweed. His surname Sais, meaning \u0027Englishman\u0027 in Welsh, refers to his ability to speak English, not common in Wales at the time. In August 1385, he served King Richard II under the command of John of Gaunt, again in Scotland. Then, in 1386, he was called to give evidence at the High Court of Chivalry, in the Scrope v Grosvenor trial at Chester on 3 September that year. In March 1387, Owain fought as a squire to Richard FitzAlan, 4th Earl of Arundel, where he saw action in the English Channel at the defeat of a Franco-Spanish-Flemish fleet off the coast of Kent during the Battle of Margate. Upon the death in late 1387 of his father-in-law, Sir David Hanmer, knighted earlier that same year by the then King of England, Richard II, Glynd\u0175r returned to Wales as executor of his estate. Glynd\u0175r next served as a squire to Henry Bolingbroke , son of John of Gaunt, at the short Battle of Radcot Bridge in December 1387. From 1384 until 1388 he had been active in military service and had gained three full years of military experience in different theatres, and had witnessed some key events and noteworthy people at first hand.\nKing Richard was distracted by a growing conflict with the Lords Appellant from this time on. Glynd\u0175r\u0027s opportunities were further limited by the death of Sir Gregory Sais in 1390 and the sidelining of FitzAlan, and he probably returned to his stable Welsh estates, living there quietly for ten years during his forties. The bard Iolo Goch, himself a Welsh Lord, visited Glynd\u0175r in Sycharth in the 1390s and wrote a number of odes to Owain, praising his host\u0027s liberality and writing of Sycharth, \u0022Very rarely was a bolt or lock to be seen there.\u0022\r\n\r\n== Glynd\u0175r\u0027s Welsh rebellion ==\n\n\n=== Prelude to rebellion ===\nIn the late 1390s, a series of events occurred which cornered Owain, and forced his ambitions towards a rebellion. The events would later be called the Welsh Revolt, the Glynd\u0175r Rising , or the Last War of Independence. His neighbour, Baron Grey of Ruthin, had seized control of some land, for which Glynd\u0175r appealed to the English Parliament; however, Owain\u0027s petition for redress was ignored. Later, in 1400, Lord Grey did not inform Glynd\u0175r in time about a royal command to levy feudal troops for Scottish border service, thus enabling him to call Glynd\u0175r a traitor in London court circles. Lord Grey had stature in the royal court of Henry IV. The law courts refused to hear the case, or it was delayed because Lord Grey prevented Owain\u0027s letter from reaching the King, which would have repercussions. Sources state that Glynd\u0175r was under threat because he had written an angry letter to Lord Grey, boasting that lands had come into his possession, and he had stolen some of Lord Grey\u0027s horses; and believing Lord Grey had threatened to \u0022burn and slay\u0022 within his lands, he threatened retaliation in the same manner. Lord Grey then denied making the initial threat to burn and slay, and replied that he would take the incriminating letter to Henry IV\u0027s council and that Glynd\u0175r would hang for the admission of theft and treason contained within the letter. The deposed king, Richard II, had support in Wales, and in January 1400 serious civil disorder broke out in the English border city of Chester after the public execution of an officer of Richard II.\n\n\n=== Initial revolts ===\nAt Sycharth, in Glyndyfrdwy on 16 September 1400, in front of his immediate family, his in-laws, Welsh people from Berwyn, friends from North-East Wales, the Dean of St Asaph totalling 300 men, Owain Glynd\u0175r prophecised that he was the person to save his people from the English invasions, and proclaimed himself the Prince of Wales. The following day, he instigated a 15-year rebellion against the rule of Henry IV. Then came a number of initial confrontations between Henry IV and Owain\u0027s followers in September and October 1400, as the revolt began to spread around North Wales. Glynd\u0175r, the self appointed Prince of Wales and his hundreds of followers launched an assault on Lord Grey\u0027s territories burning Ruthin, they continued to Denbigh, Rhuddlan, Flint, Holt, Oswestry and Welshpool, all of which were seen as English towns in Wales. The initial revolt got the attention of the King of England after letters were sent asking for military assistance to combat the Welsh rebels. Much of northern and central Wales went over to Glynd\u0175r, and from then on, he would only make an appearance to attack his enemy, his army using effective guerrilla warfare tactics against the English occupying territories.\n\n\n=== Welsh rebellion ===\n\nOn Good Friday 1401, 40 of Glyndwr\u0027s men who were led by his cousins, Rhys ap Tudur and Gwilym ap Tudur took Conwy Castle in North Wales. In response, King Henry IV appointed Henry Percy to bring the country to order. A month later, the King and the English parliament issued an amnesty on 10 March which applied to all rebels with the exception of Owain and his cousins, the Tudurs; however, both the Tudurs were eventually pardoned after they gave up Conwy Castle on 28 May that same year. Hotspur won a battle at Cadair Idris two days later, but that was to be his final service for the King of England, as he retired his command as leader of the English troops after dealing with Glynd\u0175r. During that time in the spring of 1401, Glynd\u0175r appears in South Wales.\nIn June, Glynd\u0175r scored his first major victory in the field at Mynydd Hyddgen on Pumlumon; however, retaliation by Henry IV on Strata Florida Abbey was to follow in October that same year. The rebel uprising had occupied all of North Wales; labourers seized whatever weapons they could, and farmers sold their cattle to buy arms. Secret meetings were held everywhere, and bards \u0022wandered about as messengers of sedition\u0022. Henry IV heard of a Welsh uprising at Leicester; Henry\u0027s army wandered North Wales to Anglesey and drove out Franciscan friars who favoured Richard II. All the while Glynd\u0175r, who was in hiding, had his estate at Sycharth forfeited by the King to John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset on 9 November 1400. Then, by autumn, Gwynedd and Ceredigion and Powys adhered to the rising against the English rule by supporting the rebellion. Glynd\u0175r\u0027s attempts at stoking rebellion with help from the Scottish and Irish were quashed, with the English showing no mercy and hanging some messengers.\nAs a response to the situation of warfare in Wales, the English Parliament between 1401 and 1402 enacted penal laws against the Welsh, designed to coerce submission in Wales, but the result was to create resentment that pushed many Welshmen into the rebellion. In the same year, Glynd\u0175r captured his archenemy Baron Grey de Ruthyn. He held him for almost a year until he received a substantial ransom from Henry. In June 1402, Glynd\u0175r defeated an English force led by Sir Edmund Mortimer near Pilleth , where Mortimer was captured. Glynd\u0175r offered to release Mortimer for a large ransom but, in sharp contrast to his attitude to de Grey, Henry IV refused to pay. Mortimer\u0027s nephew could be said to have had a greater claim to the English throne than Henry himself, so his speedy release was not an option. In response, Mortimer negotiated an alliance with Glynd\u0175r and married one of Glynd\u0175r\u0027s daughters. It is also in 1402 that mention of the French and the people of Flanders helping Owain\u0027s daughter Janet, who was negotiating on the continent for her father for two years until 1404.\nNews of the rebellion\u0027s success spread across Europe, and Glynd\u0175r began to receive naval support from Scotland and Brittany. He also received the support of King Charles VI of France, who agreed to send French troops and supplies to aid the rebellion. In 1403 Glyndwr had amassed an army of 4,000 in his first division, and 12,000 soldiers in total. A Welsh army including a French contingent assimilated into forces mainly from Glamorgan and the Rhondda Valleys region commanded by Owain Glynd\u0175r, his senior general Rhys Gethin and Cadwgan, Lord of Glyn Rhondda, defeated a large English invasion force reputedly led by King Henry IV himself at the Battle of Stalling Down in Glamorgan.\n\nGlynd\u0175r, facing years on the run, finally lost his estate in the spring of 1403, when Prince Henry as usual marched into Wales unopposed and burnt down Glynd\u0175r\u0027s houses at Sycharth and Glyndyfrdwy, as well as the commote of Edeirnion and parts of Powys. Glynd\u0175r continued to besiege towns and burn down castles; for 10 days in July that year, he toured the south and southwest of Wales until all of the south joined arms in rebelling against English rule. These actions induced an internal rebellion against the King of England, with the Percys joining the rising. It is around this stage of Glynd\u0175r\u0027s life that Hywel Sele, a cousin of the Welsh prince, attempted to assassinate Glynd\u0175r at the Nannau estate.\nIn 1403, the revolt became truly national in Wales. Royal officials reported that Welsh students at Oxford and Cambridge Universities were leaving their studies to join Glynd\u0175r, and also that Welsh labourers and craftsmen were abandoning their employers in England and returning to Wales. Owain could also draw on Welsh troops seasoned by the English campaigns in France and Scotland. Hundreds of Welsh archers and experienced men-at-arms left the English service to join the rebellion.\nIn 1404, Glynd\u0175r\u0027s forces took Aberystwyth Castle and Harlech Castle, then continued to ravage the south by burning Cardiff Castle. Then, a court was held at Harlech and Gruffydd Young was appointed as the Welsh Chancellor. There had been communication to Louis I, Duke of Orl\u00E9ans in Paris to try to open the Welsh ports to French trade.\n\n\n=== Crowning as Prince of Wales ===\n\nBy 1404, no less than four royal military expeditions into Wales had been repelled, and Owain had solidified his control of the nation. In 1404, he was proclaimed by his supporters Prince of Wales and held parliaments at Machynlleth and Harlech. He also planned to build two national universities , to re-introduce the traditional Welsh laws of Hywel Dda, and to establish an independent Welsh church. There were envoys from other countries including France, Scotland, and the Kingdom of Le\u00F3n . In the summer of 1405, four representatives from every commote in Wales were sent to Harlech.\n\n\n=== Tripartite indenture ===\n\nIn February 1405, Glynd\u0175r negotiated the Tripartite Indenture with Edmund Mortimer and Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland. The Indenture agreed to divide England and Wales among the three of them. Wales would extend as far as the rivers Severn and Mersey, including most of Cheshire, Shropshire and Herefordshire. The Mortimer Lords of March would take all of southern and western England and the Percys would take the north of England.\nAlthough negotiations with the lords of Ireland were unsuccessful, Glynd\u0175r had reason to hope that the French and Bretons might be more welcoming. He dispatched Gruffydd Yonge and his brother-in-law , John Hanmer, to negotiate with the French. The result was a formal treaty that promised French aid to Glynd\u0175r and the Welsh. The immediate effect seems to have been that joint Welsh and Franco-Breton forces attacked and laid siege to Kidwelly Castle. The Welsh could also count on semi-official fraternal aid from the Duchy of Brittany and from Scotland. Scots and French privateers were operating around Wales throughout Owain\u0027s war. Scottish ships had raided English settlements on the Ll\u0177n Peninsula in 1400 and 1401. In 1403, a Breton squadron defeated the English in the Channel and devastated Jersey, Guernsey and Plymouth, while the French made a landing on the Isle of Wight. By 1404, they were raiding the coast of England, with Welsh troops on board, setting fire to Dartmouth and devastating the coast of Devon.\n1405 was the \u0022Year of the French\u0022 in Wales. A formal treaty between Wales and France was negotiated. On the continent, the French pressed the English as the French army invaded the English Plantagenet Aquitaine. Simultaneously, the French landed in force at Milford Haven in west Wales, burned Haverfordwest, and attempted to capture Pembroke Castle before they were bought off. The combined forces of French and Welsh took Carmarthen, which Owain had captured in 1403 but lost again. The occupants were given safe passage out, and they burned the town walls. Enguerrand de Monstrelet, a later chronicler gives an uncorroborated account of a march through Herefordshire and on into Worcestershire to Woodbury Hill, ten miles from Worcester. They met the English army and took positions from which they daily and viewed each other from a mile without any major action for eight days. Then, both sides seeming to find engagement too risky, departed.\n\n\n=== Letter to Charles VI of France ===\n\nBy 1405, most French forces had withdrawn after politics in Paris shifted towards peace, with the Hundred Years\u0027 War continuing between England and France. On 31 March 1406 Glynd\u0175r wrote a letter to be sent to Charles VI of France in St Peter ad Vincula church at Pennal, hence its naming after the location it was written at. Glynd\u0175r\u0027s letter requested to maintain military support from the French to fend off the English in Wales. Glynd\u0175r suggested that in return, he would recognise Benedict XIII of Avignon as the Pope. The letter sets out the ambitions of Glynd\u0175r for an independent Wales with its own parliament, led by himself as Prince of Wales. These ambitions also included the return of the traditional law of Hywel Dda, rather than the enforced English law, establishment of an independent Welsh church as well as two universities, one in south Wales, and one in north Wales. Following this letter, senior churchmen and important members of society flocked to Glynd\u0175r\u0027s banner and English resistance was reduced to a few isolated castles, walled towns, and fortified manor houses.\n\nGlynd\u0175r\u0027s Great Seal and a letter handwritten by him to the French in 1406 are in the Biblioth\u00E8que nationale de France in Paris. This letter is currently held in the Archives Nationales in Paris. Facsimile copies involving specialist ageing techniques and moulds of Glynd\u0175r\u0027s seal were created by the National Library of Wales and presented by the heritage minister Alun Ffred Jones to six Welsh institutions in 2009. The royal great seal from 1404 was given to Charles IV of France and contains images and Glynd\u0175r\u0027s title \u2013 Latin: Owynus Dei Gratia Princeps Walliae \u2013 \u0022Owain, by the grace of God, Prince of Wales\u0022. Glyndwr referred to himself as the \u0022Prince of Wales\u0022 and claimed his \u0022right of inheritance\u0022 in these letters\n\n\n=== The faltering rebellion ===\n\nIn early 1405, the Welsh forces, who had until then won several easy victories, suffered a series of defeats. Glynd\u0175r\u0027s brother, Lord Tudur ap Gruffudd, a commander during the war, died at the Battle of Pwll Melyn in May 1405. English forces landed in Anglesey from Ireland and would over time push the Welsh back until the resistance in Anglesey formally ended toward the end of 1406.\nFollowing the intervention of French forces, battling ensued for years, and in 1406 Prince Henry restored fines and redemption for Welsh soldiers to choose their own fate, prisoners were taken after the battle, and castles were restored to their original owners, this same year a son of Glynd\u0175r died in battle. By 1408 Glynd\u0175r had taken refuge in the North of Wales, having lost his ally from Northumberland.\nDespite the initial success of the revolution, in 1407 the superior numbers, resources, and wealth that England had at its disposal eventually began to turn the tide of the war, and the much larger and better-equipped English forces gradually began to overwhelm the Welsh. In times of war, the English changed their strategy. Rather than focusing on punitive expeditions as favoured by his father, the young Prince Henry adopted a strategy of economic blockade. Using the castles that remained in English control, he gradually began to retake Wales while cutting off trade and the supply of weapons. By 1407, this strategy was beginning to bear fruit, and by 1408, the English regained Aberystwyth and then marched north Harlech Castle, which also surrendered during the cold winter into 1409. Edmund Mortimer died during the siege, and Owain\u0027s wife Margaret along with two of his daughters and three of Mortimer\u0027s granddaughters were captured on the fall of the castle and imprisoned in the Tower of London. They were all to die in the Tower in 1413 and were buried at St Swithin, London Stone. Before his downfall, Glynd\u0175r was considered the wealthiest of all Welshmen.\nGlynd\u0175r managed to escape capture by disguising himself as an elderly man, sneaking out of the castle and slipping past the English military blockade in the darkness of the night. Glynd\u0175r retreated to the Welsh wilderness with a band of loyal supporters; he refused to surrender and continued the war with guerrilla tactics such as launching sporadic raids and ambushes throughout Wales and the English borderlands.\n\nGlynd\u0175r remained free, but he had lost his ancestral home and was a hunted prince. He continued the rebellion, particularly wanting to avenge his wife. In 1410, Owain led a raid into rebel-controlled Shropshire, and in 1412, he carried out one of the final successful raids. With his most faithful soldiers, he cut through the King\u0027s men in an ambush in Brecon, where he captured, and later ransomed, a leading Welsh supporter of King Henry, Dafydd Gam . This was the last time that Owain was seen alive by his enemies, although it was claimed he took refuge with the Scudamore family. In the autumn, Glynd\u0175r\u0027s Aberystwyth Castle surrendered, while he was away fighting, but by then things were changing. Henry IV died in 1413, and his son Henry V began to adopt a more conciliatory attitude towards the Welsh. Royal pardons were offered to the major leaders of the revolt and other opponents of his father\u0027s regime. As late as 1414, there were rumours that the Herefordshire-based Lollard leader Sir John Oldcastle was communicating with Owain, and reinforcements were sent to the major castles in the north and south.\nOn 21 December 1411, the King of England issued pardons to all Welsh except their leader and Thomas of Trumpington . Glynd\u0175r ignored offers of a pardon on many different occasions, his followers continued to be punished for crimes of war until the 1410s. His death was recorded by a former follower in the year 1415.\n\n\n==== Disappearance ====\nNothing certain is known of Glynd\u0175r after 1412. Despite enormous rewards being offered, he was neither captured nor betrayed. He ignored royal pardons, and it is thought he died in 1415, and certainly by 1417. Adam of Usk, a one-time supporter of Glynd\u0175r, and writing after the fact, made the following entry in his Chronicle for the year 1415: \u0022he was buried at night by his followers. But his burial was detected by his opponents; so he was re-buried. But where his body lies is unknown.\u0022Thomas Pennant writes that Glynd\u0175r died on 20 September 1415 at the age of 61 .\nGlynd\u0175r may have lived his last days at Kentchurch in south Herefordshire, the home of the Scudamore family. The poet Lewys Glyn Cothi wrote an elegy for Gwenllian, an illegitimate daughter of Glynd\u0175r, where it was mentioned that at the time of the Welsh War of independence, the whole of Wales was under Glynd\u0175r\u0027s command, with forty dukes as the prince\u0027s allies, and that later in life he supported 62 female pensioners.\nThere are many folk tales of Glynd\u0175r donning disguises to gain an advantage over opponents during the rebellion, and after his disappearance, there has been persistent speculation that the Welsh religious poet, Si\u00F4n Cent, the family chaplain of the Scudamore family, was Owain Glynd\u0175r in disguise.\n\n\n=== Burial ===\nAlthough the location of his burial is unknown, there has long been speculation where Glynd\u0175r\u0027s final resting place may be. In 1875, the Rev. Francis Kilvert wrote in his diary that he saw the grave of \u0022Owen Glendower\u0022 in the churchyard at Monnington on Wye \u0022[h]ard by the church porch and on the western side of it ... It is a flat stone of whitish-grey shaped like a rude obelisk figure, sunk deep into the ground in the middle of an oblong patch of earth from which the turf has been pared away, and, alas, smashed into several fragments.\u0022  Another nearby location is suggested by Adrien Jones, the president of the Owain Glynd\u0175r Society, who stated, \u0022Four years ago we visited a direct descendant of Glynd\u0175r, a John Skidmore, at Kentchurch Court, near Abergavenny. He took us to Mornington Straddle in Herefordshire, where one of Glynd\u0175r\u0027s daughters, Alice, lived. Mr. Skidmore told us that he spent his last days there and eventually died there... It was a family secret for 600 years, and even Mr Skidmore\u0027s mother, who died shortly before we visited, refused to reveal the secret. There\u0027s even a mound where he is believed to be buried at Mornington Straddle.\u0022\nThe historian Gruffydd Aled Williams suggests in a 2017 monograph that the burial site is in the Kimbolton Chapel near Leominster, the present parish church of St James the Great which used to be the chapelry of Leominster Priory, based upon a number of manuscripts held in the National Archives. Although Kimbolton is an unexceptional and relatively unknown place outside of Herefordshire, it is closely connected to the Scudamore family.\r\n\r\n== Issue and descendants ==\n\nOwain married Margaret Hanmer, also known by her Welsh name Marred ferch Dafydd, and together they had five or six sons and four or five daughters. Also, Owain had some illegitimate children out of wedlock.\n\n\n=== Sons ===\nGruffudd d. 1411.\nMadog.\nMaredudd alive in 1421.\nThomas.\nJohn.\nAll of Owain and Margaret\u0027s sons from their marriage were either taken prisoner and died in confinement, or died in battle and had no issue. Gruffudd was captured in Gwent by Prince Henry, imprisoned in Nottingham Castle, and later taken to the Tower of London in 1410. Maredudd was recorded as communicating with John Talbot and the English Crown on 24 February 1416, and receiving a royal pardon in 1421, but dying a few years later.\n\n\n=== Daughters ===\nAlice , m. John Scudamore of Ewyas.\nJane.\nJanet, m. Sir John De Croft.\nMargaret, m. Sir Richard Monnington.\nCatherine  , m. Edmund Mortimer , Roger Mortimer.\nUpon Owain\u0027s disappearance and death, his eldest daughter Alice came to be known as the Lady of Glyndyfrdwy and Cynllaith, and heiress de jure of the Principalities of Powys, South Wales and Gwynedd. During 1431, she successfully went to court in Meirionydd to regain her inheritance as the heiress of Sycharth in Glyndyfrdwy against John, Earl of Somerset, who had been granted Owain\u0027s forfeited lands by the King of England in 1400. Alice\u0027s descendants married into the Scudamore family and her direct descendant John Lucy Scudamore married the daughter of Harford Jones-Brydges in the early 19th century, and whose daughter in 1852 married the son of Edward Lucas from the Castleshane estate in Ireland. Another daughter, Jane, married Henry, Lord Grey de Ruthin without issue. Then, Janet married into the noble family of Croft Castle in Herefordshire, whose descendants today are titled the Croft Baronets. Whilst Margaret married a knight from Monnington, also in Herefordshire.\n\n\n=== Illegitimate ===\nGlynd\u0175r\u0027s illegitimate children with other women included Ieuan, Myfanwy and Gwenllian, whilst it is debated whether his son David was born out of wedlock. Ieuan became Glynd\u0175r\u0027s only male descendant to have children. Like his other illegitimate kin, they remained in Wales and married locally into Welsh families. Gwenllian became the wife of Philip ab Rhys ab Cenarth, and died near St Harmon in Powys .\n\n\n=== Family poem ===\nIolo Goch wrote of Glynd\u0175r\u0027s wife, Margaret:\n\nThe best of wives.\nEminent woman of a knightly family,\nHer children come in pairs,\n\nA beautiful nest of chieftains.\r\n\r\n== Welsh kingdoms lineage ==\nOwain Glynd\u0175r had claims to royal ancestry from all three of the final ruling royal houses of Wales; Powys and Deheubarth , and Gwynedd . His claims were clearest for the first two of these:\n\n\n=== Gwynedd ancestry ===\nAs well as being a direct genealogical descendant of the final ruling monarchs of Powys and Deheubarth, Owain Glyndwr\u0027s ancestors were also descended from the Welsh medieval Kingdom of Gwynedd, descended from the Gwynedd King Gruffudd ap Cynan , via his great-grandmother Gwenllian. However, some sources claim that another ruler of Gwynedd, Llywelyn ap Iorwerth , Gruffudd ap Cynan\u0027s great-grandson, was Glyndwr\u0027s nearest Gwynedd royal ancestor. Elsewhere, a third suggestion is that he was descended from Llywelyn II, Prince of Wales , and his daughter Catherine. Llywelyn II was Llywelyn I\u0027s grandson, and also the penultimate Prince of Gwynedd from the final generation of the Aberffraw rulers in Wales before his brother, Dafydd III. Yet some historians note that Llywelyn II\u0027s only recorded child was a daughter, Gwenllian, who died in 1337 without issue. Professor John Edward Lloyd said: \u0022There is no evidence that Llywelyn had any daughter but Gwenllian, born in the last year of his life and after his death confined for the rest of her days as a nun of the order of Sempringham\u0022. Lloyd\u0027s assessment has been repeated by those scholars. The claim to Gwynedd heritage through female lines, however, was subject to Welsh law and was legitimate, albeit with the recognition that \u0022the direct male line of Gwynedd had undeniably become extinct in 1378. Its last representative was Owain Lawgoch.\u0022\r\n\r\n== Banners and coat of arms ==\r\n\r\n== Legacy ==\nIn Welsh culture Glynd\u0175r acquired a mythical status alongside other medieval kings such as Cadwaladr, Cynon ap Clydno and King Arthur. He was perceived as a folk hero awaiting a call to return and liberate his people in the classic Welsh mythical role \u2013 Y Mab Darogan . The myth was that one day after a thousand years of servitude under English rule, a \u0027Son of Prophecy\u0027 would return the Welsh people as rulers of the island of Great Britain. Also, in Welsh folklore, the name Owain has been connected to a legend of the \u0027son of destiny\u0027. His claim as the Prince of Wales was similar to that of another distant relative from the Gwynedd dynasty. It was another Owain, Lawgoch who proclaimed his patrimony a few decades earlier, when he attempted to regain his family stature with aid from the King of France in a Franco-Welsh alliance from the late 1360s, until his assassination in 1378.\n\n\n=== Modern legacy ===\n\nGlynd\u0175r was described by Fidel Castro as the first effective guerrilla leader. It has been suggested that Castro, who may have kept books about the Welshman, and Che Guevara copied some of Glynd\u0175r\u0027s methods in the Cuban Revolution.\nDuring the First World War, the prime minister David Lloyd George unveiled a statue to Glynd\u0175r in Cardiff City Hall. A statue of Glynd\u0175r by the sculptor Simon van de Put was installed in The Square in Corwen in 1995, and in 2007 it was replaced with a larger equestrian statue by Colin Spofforth.\nGlynd\u0175r came second to Aneurin Bevan in the 100 Welsh Heroes poll of 2003/2004. Stamps were issued with his likeness in 1974 and 2008, and streets, parks, and public squares were named after him throughout Wales. There is a campaign to make 16 September , the date Glynd\u0175r raised his standard, a public holiday in Wales, including by Dafydd Wigley in 2021.\nRGC 1404 rugby union team is named in honour of the year Owain Glynd\u0175r was crowned Prince of Wales.\nTo celebrate the 600th anniversary of Glynd\u0175r\u0027s life, a monument was erected in Machynlleth in the grounds of Plas Machynlleth.\nIn January 2025 a mural depicting Glyndwr appeared overnight in Ruthin, North Wales. He was shown on horseback waving a sword. Due to its technique the work was originally thought to be by Banksy but it was in fact from the artist DNZ.\n\n\n==== Meibion Glynd\u0175r ====\nGlynd\u0175r is now remembered as a national hero and numerous small groups have adopted his symbolism to advocate independence for Wales or Welsh nationalism. For example, during the 1980s, a group calling itself Meibion Glynd\u0175r claimed responsibility for the burning of English holiday homes in Wales.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\nAfter Glynd\u0175r\u0027s death, there was little resistance to English rule. The Tudor dynasty saw Welshmen become more prominent in English society. In Henry IV, Part 1, Shakespeare portrays him as Owen Glendower , wild and exotic; a man who claims to be able to \u0022call spirits from the vasty deep\u0022, ruled by magic and tradition in sharp contrast to the more logical but highly emotional Hotspur. Glendower is further noted as being \u0022not in the roll of common men\u0022 and \u0022a worthy gentleman,/Exceedingly well read, and profited/ In strange concealments, valiant as a lion/And as wondrous affable and as bountiful/As mines of India.\u0022 His enemies describe him \u0022that damn\u0027d magician\u0022, which was in reference to having the weather on his side in battle.\nIt was not until the late 19th century that Glynd\u0175r\u0027s reputation was revived, when the Cymru Fydd movement recreated Glynd\u0175r as the father of Welsh nationalism.\nGlynd\u0175r later acquired mythical status as the hero awaiting a call to return and liberate his people. Thomas Pennant, in his Tours in Wales , searched out and published many of the legends and places associated with the memory of Glynd\u0175r. Glynd\u0175r has been featured in a number of works of modern fiction, including most notably John Cowper Powys\u0027s novel Owen Glendower , and Edith Pargeter\u0027s 1972 publication A Bloody Field by Shrewsbury.\nA highly fictionalized Glynd\u0175r is featured in the popular YA book series The Raven Cycle by Maggie Stiefvater as Owen Glendower. In the series, which takes place in the Shenandoah Valley, characters believe that Glynd\u0175r\u0027s body was brought from Wales to Virginia after his death, and that whoever can \u0022wake\u0022 him will be granted a favor.\nIn 2026, a new play by Gary Owen called Owain \u0026 Henry, about Glynd\u0175r\u0027s rebellion against the rule of Henry IV of England in the 15th century, will be performed at the Welsh National Theatre with Michael Sheen playing Glynd\u0175r.\n\n\n=== Namesakes ===\n\nThe Owain Glyndwr Hotel in Corwen is a historic 18th century coaching inn.\nThe Owain Glynd\u0175r pub in Cardiff, briefly named Owen Glendower was named in his honour.\nThe waymarked, 132-mile long-distance footpath Glynd\u0175r\u0027s Way runs through Mid Wales near to his homelands.\nAt least two ships and two locomotives have been named after Glynd\u0175r:\nIn 1808, the Royal Navy launched a 36-gun fifth-rate frigate,HMS Owen Glendower. She served in the Baltic Sea during the Gunboat War where she participated in the seizure of Anholt Island, and then in the Channel. Between 1822 and 1824, she served in the West Africa Squadron chasing down slave ships, capturing at least two;\nOwen Glendower, an East Indiaman, a Blackwall frigate built in 1839;\nIn 1923, a 2-6-2T Vale of Rheidol locomotive was named after Glynd\u0175r. The locomotive is still operational and was one of a few used by British Rail until it was privatised;\n70010 Owen Glendower, renamed Owain Glynd\u0175r, built in 1951 at the Crewe Works, it was withdrawn in June 1965. It was a British Railways Standard Class 7 mixed-traffic steam locomotive.\nIn 2002, a plaque was unveiled near the Tower of London to commemorate Glyndwr\u0027s Glynd\u0175r Catrin who died there with her children.\nFrom 2008 to 2023, Wrexham University was known as Glynd\u0175r University in his honour. Despite dropping the name in 2023, the university maintains links with the Owain Glynd\u0175r Society for one of its annual graduate awards.\r\n\r\n== Royal succession ==",
