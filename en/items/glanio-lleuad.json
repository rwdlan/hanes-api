Kennedy: \u0022before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth\u0022.\r\n\r\n== Background ==\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, the United States was engaged in the Cold War, a geopolitical rivalry with the Soviet Union. On October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1, the first artificial satellite, surprising the world and fueling fears about Soviet technological and military capabilities. Its success demonstrated that the USSR could potentially deliver nuclear weapons over intercontinental distances, challenging American claims of military, economic, and technological superiority. This sparked the Sputnik crisis and ignited the Space Race, as both superpowers sought to demonstrate their superiority in spaceflight. President Dwight D. Eisenhower responded to the challenge posed by Sputnik by creating the National Aeronautics and Space Administration , and initiating Project Mercury, which aimed to place a man into Earth orbit. The Soviets took the lead on April 12, 1961, when cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first person in space and the first to orbit the Earth. Nearly a month later, on May 5, 1961, Alan Shepard became the first American in space; his 15-minute flight was suborbital, not a full orbit.\nBecause the Soviet Union had launch vehicles with higher lift capacity, President John F. Kennedy, Eisenhower\u0027s successor, chose a challenge that exceeded the capabilities of the existing generation of rockets, so that the U.S. and Soviet Union would be starting from a position of equality. A crewed mission to the Moon would serve this purpose.\nOn May 25, 1961, Kennedy addressed the United States Congress on \u0022Urgent National Needs\u0022 and declared:\n\nI believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade [1960s] is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth. No single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important for the long-range exploration of space; and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish. We propose to accelerate the development of the appropriate lunar space craft. We propose to develop alternate liquid and solid fuel boosters, much larger than any now being developed, until certain which is superior. We propose additional funds for other engine development and for unmanned explorations\u2014explorations which are particularly important for one purpose which this nation will never overlook: the survival of the man who first makes this daring flight. But in a very real sense, it will not be one man going to the Moon\u2014if we make this judgment affirmatively, it will be an entire nation. For all of us must work to put him there. \nOn September 12, 1962, Kennedy delivered another speech before a crowd of about 40,000 people in the Rice University football stadium in Houston, Texas. A widely quoted refrain from the middle portion of the speech reads as follows:\n\nThere is no strife, no prejudice, no national conflict in outer space as yet. Its hazards are hostile to us all. Its conquest deserves the best of all mankind, and its opportunity for peaceful cooperation may never come again. But why, some say, the Moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may well ask, why climb the highest mountain? Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic? Why does Rice play Texas?\nWe choose to go to the Moon! We choose to go to the Moon ... We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard; because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one we intend to win, and the others, too.\n\nIn spite of that, the proposed program faced the opposition of many Americans and was dubbed a \u0022moondoggle\u0022 by Norbert Wiener, a mathematician at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The effort to land a man on the Moon already had a name: Project Apollo. When Kennedy met with Nikita Khrushchev, the Premier of the Soviet Union in June 1961, he proposed making the Moon landing a joint project, but Khrushchev did not take up the offer. Kennedy again proposed a joint expedition to the Moon in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly on September 20, 1963. The idea of a joint Moon mission was abandoned after Kennedy\u0027s death.\nAn early and crucial decision was choosing lunar orbit rendezvous over both direct ascent and Earth orbit rendezvous. A space rendezvous is an orbital maneuver in which two spacecraft navigate through space and meet up. In July 1962 NASA head James Webb announced that lunar orbit rendezvous would be used and that the Apollo spacecraft would have three major parts: a command module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that returned to Earth; a service module , which supported the command module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a lunar module that had two stages\u2014a descent stage for landing on the Moon, and an ascent stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit. This design meant the spacecraft could be launched by a single Saturn V rocket that was then under development.\nTechnologies and techniques required for Apollo were developed by Project Gemini. The Apollo project was enabled by NASA\u0027s adoption of new advances in semiconductor device, including metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor field-effect transistors in the Interplanetary Monitoring Platform and silicon integrated circuit chips in the Apollo Guidance Computer .\nProject Apollo was abruptly halted by the Apollo 1 fire on January 27, 1967, in which astronauts Gus Grissom, Ed White, and Roger B. Chaffee died, and the subsequent investigation. In October 1968, Apollo 7 evaluated the command module in Earth orbit, and in December Apollo 8 tested it in lunar orbit. In March 1969, Apollo 9 put the lunar module through its paces in Earth orbit, and in May Apollo 10 conducted a \u0022dress rehearsal\u0022 in lunar orbit. By July 1969, all was in readiness for Apollo 11 to take the final step onto the Moon.\nThe Soviet Union appeared to be winning the Space Race by beating the US to firsts, but its early lead was overtaken by the US Gemini program and Soviet failure to develop the N1 launcher, which would have been comparable to the Saturn V. The Soviets tried to beat the US to return lunar material to the Earth by means of uncrewed probes. On July 13, three days before Apollo 11\u0027s launch, the Soviet Union launched Luna 15, which reached lunar orbit before Apollo 11. During descent, a malfunction caused Luna 15 to crash in Mare Crisium about two hours before Armstrong and Aldrin took off from the Moon\u0027s surface to begin their voyage home. The Nuffield Radio Astronomy Laboratories radio telescope in England recorded transmissions from Luna 15 during its descent, and these were released in July 2009 for the 40th anniversary of Apollo 11.\r\n\r\n== Personnel ==\n\n\n=== Prime crew ===\n\nThe initial crew assignment of Commander Neil Armstrong, Command Module Pilot Jim Lovell, and Lunar Module Pilot Buzz Aldrin on the backup crew for Apollo 9 was officially announced on November 20, 1967. Lovell and Aldrin had previously flown together as the crew of Gemini 12. Due to design and manufacturing delays in the LM, Apollo 8 and Apollo 9 swapped prime and backup crews, and Armstrong\u0027s crew became the backup for Apollo 8. Based on the normal crew rotation scheme, Armstrong was then expected to command Apollo 11.\nThere would be one change. Michael Collins, the CMP on the Apollo 8 crew, began experiencing trouble with his legs. Doctors diagnosed a bony growth between his fifth and sixth vertebrae, requiring surgery. Lovell took his place on the Apollo 8 crew, and when Collins recovered he joined Armstrong\u0027s crew as CMP. In the meantime, Fred Haise filled in as backup LMP, and Aldrin as backup CMP for Apollo 8. Apollo 11 was the second American mission where all the crew members had prior spaceflight experience, the first being Apollo 10. The next was STS-26 in 1988.\nDeke Slayton gave Armstrong the option to replace Aldrin with Lovell, since some thought Aldrin was difficult to work with. Armstrong had no issues working with Aldrin but thought it over for a day before declining. He thought Lovell deserved to command his own mission .\nThe Apollo 11 prime crew had none of the close cheerful camaraderie characterized by that of Apollo 12. Instead, they forged an amiable working relationship. Armstrong in particular was notoriously aloof, but Collins, who considered himself a loner, confessed to rebuffing Aldrin\u0027s attempts to create a more personal relationship. Aldrin and Collins described the crew as \u0022amiable strangers\u0022. Armstrong did not agree with the assessment, and said \u0022all the crews I was on worked very well together.\u0022\n\n\n=== Backup crew ===\n\nThe backup crew consisted of Lovell as Commander, William Anders as CMP, and Haise as LMP. Anders had flown with Lovell on Apollo 8. In early 1969, Anders accepted a job with the National Aeronautics and Space Council effective August 1969, and announced he would retire as an astronaut at that time. Ken Mattingly was moved from the support crew into parallel training with Anders as backup CMP in case Apollo 11 was delayed past its intended July launch date, at which point Anders would be unavailable.\nUnder the normal Apollo crew rotation, Lovell, Mattingly, and Haise would have been assigned to Apollo 14. However, because Alan Shepard had only recently returned to flight status and needed additional training, NASA reassigned his crew to Apollo 14 and moved Lovell\u0027s crew up to fly Apollo 13 instead. Shortly before launch, Mattingly was replaced by Jack Swigert due to concerns over possible measles exposure.\n\n\n=== Support crew ===\nDuring Projects Mercury and Gemini, each mission had a prime and a backup crew. For Apollo, NASA added a third group, the support crew. Their job was to maintain the flight plan, checklists, and mission rules, and to keep the prime and backup crews updated on any changes. They also developed procedures\u2014especially for emergencies, so that by the time the prime and backup crews entered the simulators, they could focus on practicing and mastering them. The support crew for Apollo 11 was Mattingly, Ronald Evans, and Bill Pogue.\n\n\n=== Capsule communicators ===\n\nThe capsule communicator was an astronaut stationed at the Mission Control Center in Houston, Texas, and was typically the only person permitted to communicate directly with the flight crew. This practice ensured that messages came from someone best able to understand the situation in the spacecraft and to relay guidance from flight controllers as clearly as possible. For Apollo 11, the CAPCOMs were backup and support crew members Anders, Evans, Haise, Lovell, and Mattingly, along with Charles Duke, Owen Garriott, Don L. Lind, Bruce McCandless II, and Harrison Schmitt.\n\n\n=== Flight directors ===\nThe flight directors for this mission were:\n\n\n=== Other key personnel ===\nOther key personnel who played important roles in the Apollo 11 mission include the following.\r\n\r\n== Preparations ==\n\n\n=== Insignia ===\n\nThe Apollo 11 mission emblem was designed by Collins, who wanted a symbol for \u0022peaceful lunar landing by the United States\u0022. At Lovell\u0027s suggestion, he chose the bald eagle, the national bird of the United States, as the symbol. Tom Wilson, a simulator instructor, suggested an olive branch in its beak to represent their peaceful mission. Collins added a lunar background with the Earth in the distance. The sunlight in the image was coming from the wrong direction; the shadow should have been in the lower part of the Earth instead of the left. Aldrin, Armstrong and Collins decided the Eagle and the Moon would be in their natural colors, and decided on a blue and gold border. Armstrong was concerned that \u0022eleven\u0022 would not be understood by non-English speakers, so they went with \u0022Apollo 11\u0022, and they decided not to put their names on the patch, so it would \u0022be representative of everyone who had worked toward a lunar landing\u0022.\nAn illustrator at the Manned Spacecraft Center did the artwork, which was then sent off to NASA officials for approval. The design was rejected. Bob Gilruth, the director of the MSC felt the talons of the eagle looked \u0022too warlike\u0022. After some discussion, the olive branch was moved to the talons. When the Eisenhower dollar coin was released in 1971, the patch design provided the eagle for its reverse side. The design was also used for the smaller Susan B. Anthony dollar unveiled in 1979.\n\n\n=== Call signs ===\n\nAfter the crew of Apollo 10 named their spacecraft Charlie Brown and Snoopy, assistant manager for public affairs Julian Scheer wrote to George Low, the Manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office at the MSC, to suggest the Apollo 11 crew be less flippant in naming their craft. The name Snowcone was used for the CM and Haystack was used for the LM in both internal and external communications during early mission planning.\nThe LM was named Eagle after the motif which was featured prominently on the mission insignia. At Scheer\u0027s suggestion, the CM was named Columbia after Columbiad, the giant cannon that launched a spacecraft in Jules Verne\u0027s 1865 novel From the Earth to the Moon. It also referred to Columbia, a historical name of the United States. In Collins\u0027 1976 book, he said Columbia was in reference to Christopher Columbus.\n\n\n=== Mementos ===\n\nThe astronauts had personal preference kits , small bags containing personal items of significance they wanted to take with them on the mission. Five 0.5-pound PPKs were carried on Apollo 11: three were stowed on Columbia before launch, and two on Eagle.\nNeil Armstrong\u0027s LM PPK contained a piece of wood from the Wright brothers\u0027 1903 Wright Flyer\u0027s left propeller and a piece of fabric from its wing, along with a diamond-studded astronaut pin originally given to Slayton by the widows of the Apollo 1 crew. This pin had been intended to be flown on that mission and given to Slayton afterwards, but following the disastrous launch pad fire and subsequent funerals, the widows gave the pin to Slayton. Armstrong took it with him on Apollo 11.\n\n\n=== Site selection ===\n\nNASA\u0027s Apollo Site Selection Board announced five potential landing sites on February 8, 1968. These were the result of two years\u0027 worth of studies based on high-resolution photography of the lunar surface by the five uncrewed probes of the Lunar Orbiter program and information about surface conditions provided by the Surveyor program. The best Earth-bound telescopes could not resolve features with the resolution Project Apollo required. The landing site had to be close to the lunar equator to minimize the amount of propellant required, clear of obstacles to minimize maneuvering, and flat to simplify the task of the landing radar. Scientific value was not a consideration.\nAreas that appeared promising on photographs taken on Earth were often found to be totally unacceptable. The original requirement that the site be free of craters had to be relaxed, as no such site was found. Five sites were considered: Sites 1 and 2 were in the Sea of Tranquility ; Site 3 was in the Central Bay ; and Sites 4 and 5 were in the Ocean of Storms .\nThe final site selection was based on seven criteria:\n\nThe site needed to be smooth, with relatively few craters;\nwith approach paths free of large hills, tall cliffs or deep craters that might confuse the landing radar and cause it to issue incorrect readings;\nreachable with a minimum amount of propellant;\nallowing for delays in the launch countdown;\nproviding the Apollo spacecraft with a free-return trajectory, one that would allow it to coast around the Moon and safely return to Earth without requiring any engine firings should a problem arise on the way to the Moon;\nwith good visibility during the landing approach, meaning the Sun would be between 7 and 20 degrees behind the LM; and\na general slope of less than two degrees in the landing area.\nThe requirement for the Sun angle was particularly restrictive, limiting the launch date to one day per month. A landing just after dawn was chosen to limit the temperature extremes the astronauts would experience. The Apollo Site Selection Board selected Site 2, with Sites 3 and 5 as backups in the event of the launch being delayed. In May 1969, Apollo 10\u0027s lunar module flew to within 15 kilometers of Site 2, and reported it was acceptable.\n\n\n=== First-step decision ===\nDuring the first press conference after the Apollo 11 crew was announced, the first question was, \u0022Which one of you gentlemen will be the first man to step onto the lunar surface?\u0022 Slayton told the reporter it had not been decided, and Armstrong added that it was \u0022not based on individual desire\u0022.\nOne of the first versions of the egress checklist had the lunar module pilot exit the spacecraft before the commander, which matched what had been done on Gemini missions, where the commander had never performed the spacewalk. Reporters wrote in early 1969 that Aldrin would be the first man to walk on the Moon, and Associate Administrator George Mueller told reporters he would be first as well. Aldrin heard that Armstrong would be the first because Armstrong was a civilian, which made Aldrin livid. Aldrin attempted to persuade other Lunar Module pilots he should be first, but they responded cynically about what they perceived as a lobbying campaign. Attempting to stem interdepartmental conflict, Slayton told Aldrin that Armstrong would be first since he was the commander. The decision was announced in a press conference on April 14, 1969.\nFor decades, Aldrin believed the final decision was largely driven by the Lunar Module\u0027s hatch location. Because the astronauts had their spacesuits on and the spacecraft was so small, maneuvering to exit the spacecraft was difficult. The crew tried a simulation in which Aldrin left the spacecraft first, but he damaged the simulator while attempting to egress. While this was enough for mission planners to make their decision, Aldrin and Armstrong were left in the dark on the decision until late spring. Slayton told Armstrong the plan was to have him leave the spacecraft first, if he agreed. Armstrong said, \u0022Yes, that\u0027s the way to do it.\u0022\nThe media accused Armstrong of exercising his commander\u0027s prerogative to exit the spacecraft first. Chris Kraft revealed in his 2001 autobiography that a meeting occurred between Gilruth, Slayton, Low, and himself to make sure Aldrin would not be the first to walk on the Moon. They argued that the first person to walk on the Moon should be like Charles Lindbergh, a calm and quiet person. They made the decision to change the flight plan so the commander was the first to egress from the spacecraft.\n\n\n=== Pre-launch ===\n\nThe ascent stage of LM-5 Eagle arrived at the Kennedy Space Center on January 8, 1969, followed by the descent stage four days later, and CSM-107 Columbia on January 23. There were several differences between Eagle and Apollo 10\u0027s LM-4 Snoopy; Eagle had a VHF radio antenna to facilitate communication with the astronauts during their EVA on the lunar surface; a lighter ascent engine; more thermal protection on the landing gear; and a package of scientific experiments known as the Early Apollo Scientific Experiments Package . The only change in the configuration of the command module was the removal of some insulation from the forward hatch. The CSM was mated on January 29, and moved from the Operations and Checkout Building to the Vehicle Assembly Building on April 14.\nThe S-IVB third stage of Saturn V AS-506 had arrived on January 18, followed by the S-II second stage on February 6, S-IC first stage on February 20, and the Saturn V Instrument Unit on February 27. At 12:30 on May 20, the 5,443-tonne assembly departed the Vehicle Assembly Building atop the crawler-transporter, bound for Launch Pad 39A, part of Launch Complex 39, while Apollo 10 was still on its way to the Moon. A countdown test commenced on June 26, and concluded on July 2. The launch complex was floodlit on the night of July 15, when the crawler-transporter carried the mobile service structure back to its parking area. In the early hours of the morning, the fuel tanks of the S-II and S-IVB stages were filled with liquid hydrogen. Fueling was completed by three hours before launch. Launch operations were partly automated, with 43 programs written in the ATOLL programming language.\nSlayton roused the crew shortly after 04:00, and they showered, shaved, and had the traditional pre-flight breakfast of steak and eggs with Slayton and the backup crew. They then donned their space suits and began breathing pure oxygen. At 06:30, they headed out to Launch Complex 39. Haise entered Columbia about three hours and ten minutes before launch time. Along with a technician, he helped Armstrong into the left-hand couch at 06:54. Five minutes later, Collins joined him, taking up his position on the right-hand couch. Finally, Aldrin entered, taking the center couch. Haise left around two hours and ten minutes before launch. The closeout crew sealed the hatch, and the cabin was purged and pressurized. The closeout crew then left the launch complex about an hour before launch time. The countdown became automated at three minutes and twenty seconds before launch time. Over 450 personnel were at the consoles in the firing room.\r\n\r\n== Mission ==\n\n\n=== Launch and flight to lunar orbit ===\n\nAn estimated one million spectators watched the launch of Apollo 11 from the highways and beaches in the vicinity of the launch site. Dignitaries included the Chief of Staff of the United States Army, General William Westmoreland, four cabinet members, 19 state governors, 40 mayors, 60 ambassadors and 200 congressmen. Vice President Spiro Agnew viewed the launch with former president Lyndon B. Johnson and his wife Lady Bird Johnson. Around 3,500 media representatives were present. About two-thirds were from the United States; the rest came from 55 other countries. The launch was televised live in 33 countries, with an estimated 25 million viewers in the United States alone. Millions more around the world listened to radio broadcasts. President Richard Nixon viewed the launch from his office in the White House with his NASA liaison officer, Apollo astronaut Frank Borman. Lodging near Cape Canaveral was reported as being booked months ahead in advance for the launch by a Florida newspaper.\nSaturn V AS-506 launched Apollo 11 on July 16, 1969, at 13:32:00 UTC . At 13.2 seconds into the flight, the launch vehicle began to roll into its flight azimuth of 72.058\u00B0. Full shutdown of the first-stage engines occurred about 2 minutes and 42 seconds into the mission, followed by separation of the S-IC and ignition of the S-II engines. The second stage engines then cut off and separated at about 9 minutes and 8 seconds, allowing the first ignition of the S-IVB engine a few seconds later.\nApollo 11 entered a near-circular Earth orbit at an altitude of 100.4 nautical miles by 98.9 nautical miles , twelve minutes into its flight. After one and a half orbits, a second ignition of the S-IVB engine pushed the spacecraft onto its trajectory toward the Moon with the trans-lunar injection burn at 16:22:13 UTC. About 30 minutes later, with Collins in the left seat and at the controls, the transposition, docking, and extraction maneuver was performed. This involved separating Columbia from the spent S-IVB stage, turning around, and docking with Eagle still attached to the stage. After the LM was extracted, the combined spacecraft headed for the Moon, while the rocket stage flew on a trajectory past the Moon. This was done to avoid the third stage colliding with the spacecraft, the Earth, or the Moon. A slingshot effect from passing around the Moon threw it into an orbit around the Sun.\nOn July 19 at 17:21:50 UTC, Apollo 11 passed behind the Moon and fired its service propulsion engine to enter lunar orbit. In the thirty orbits that followed, the crew saw passing views of their landing site in the southern Sea of Tranquility about 12 miles southwest of the crater Sabine D. The site was selected in part because it had been characterized as relatively flat and smooth by the automated Ranger 8 and Surveyor 5 landers and the Lunar Orbiter mapping spacecraft, and because it was unlikely to present major landing or EVA challenges. It lay about 25 kilometers southeast of the Surveyor 5 landing site, and 68 kilometers southwest of Ranger 8\u0027s crash site.\n\n\n=== Lunar descent ===\n\nAt 12:52:00 UTC on July 20, Aldrin and Armstrong entered Eagle, and began the final preparations for lunar descent. At 17:44:00 Eagle separated from Columbia. Collins, alone aboard Columbia, inspected Eagle as it pirouetted before him to ensure the craft was not damaged, and that the landing gear was correctly deployed. Armstrong exclaimed: \u0022The Eagle has wings!\u0022\nAs the descent began, Armstrong and Aldrin found themselves passing landmarks on the surface two or three seconds early, and reported that they were \u0022long\u0022; they would land miles west of their target point. Eagle was traveling too fast. The problem could have been mascons\u2014concen\u00ADtra\u00ADtions of high mass in a region or regions of the Moon\u0027s crust that contains a gravitational anomaly, potentially altering Eagle\u0027s trajectory. Flight Director Gene Kranz speculated that it could have resulted from extra air pressure in the docking tunnel, or a result of Eagle\u0027s pirouette maneuver.\nFive minutes into the descent burn, and 6,000 feet above the surface of the Moon, the LM guidance computer distracted the crew with the first of several unexpected 1201 and 1202 program alarms. Inside Mission Control Center, computer engineer Jack Garman told Guidance Officer Steve Bales it was safe to continue the descent, and this was relayed to the crew. The program alarms indicated \u0022executive overflows\u0022, meaning the guidance computer could not complete all its tasks in real-time and had to postpone some of them. Margaret Hamilton, the Director of Apollo Flight Computer Programming at the MIT Charles Stark Draper Laboratory later recalled:\n\nTo blame the computer for the Apollo 11 problems is like blaming the person who spots a fire and calls the fire department. Actually, the computer was programmed to do more than recognize error conditions. A complete set of recovery programs was incorporated into the software. The software\u0027s action, in this case, was to eliminate lower priority tasks and re-establish the more important ones. The computer, rather than almost forcing an abort, prevented an abort. If the computer hadn\u0027t recognized this problem and taken recovery action, I doubt if Apollo 11 would have been the successful Moon landing it was.\nDuring the mission, the cause was diagnosed as the rendezvous radar switch being in the wrong position, causing the computer to process data from both the rendezvous and landing radars at the same time. Software engineer Don Eyles concluded in a 2005 Guidance and Control Conference paper that the problem was due to a hardware design bug previously seen during testing of the first uncrewed LM in Apollo 5. Having the rendezvous radar on should have been irrelevant to the computer, but an electrical phasing mismatch between two parts of the rendezvous radar system could cause the stationary antenna to appear to the computer as dithering back and forth between two positions, depending upon how the hardware randomly powered up. The extra spurious cycle stealing, as the rendezvous radar updated an involuntary counter, caused the computer alarms.\n\n\n=== Landing ===\n\nWhen Armstrong again looked outside, he saw that the computer\u0027s landing target was in a boulder-strewn area just north and east of a 300-foot-diameter crater , so he took semi-automatic control. Armstrong considered landing short of the boulder field so they could collect geological samples from it, but could not since their horizontal velocity was too high. Throughout the descent, Aldrin called out navigation data to Armstrong, who was busy piloting Eagle. Now 107 feet above the surface, Armstrong knew their propellant supply was dwindling and was determined to land at the first possible landing site.\nArmstrong found a clear patch of ground and maneuvered the spacecraft towards it. As he got closer, now 250 feet above the surface, he discovered his new landing site had a crater in it. He cleared the crater and found another patch of level ground. They were now 100 feet from the surface, with only 90 seconds of propellant remaining. Lunar dust kicked up by the LM\u0027s engine began to impair his ability to determine the spacecraft\u0027s motion. Some large rocks jutted out of the dust cloud, and Armstrong focused on them during his descent so he could determine the spacecraft\u0027s speed.\nA light informed Aldrin that at least one of the 67-inch probes hanging from Eagle\u0027s footpads had touched the surface a few moments before the landing and he said: \u0022Contact light!\u0022 Armstrong was supposed to immediately shut the engine down, as the engineers suspected the pressure caused by the engine\u0027s own exhaust reflecting off the lunar surface could make it explode, but he forgot. Three seconds later, Eagle landed and Armstrong shut the engine down. Aldrin immediately said \u0022Okay, engine stop. ACA\u2014out of detent.\u0022 Armstrong acknowledged: \u0022Out of detent. Auto.\u0022 Aldrin continued: \u0022Mode control\u2014both auto. Descent engine command override off. Engine arm\u2014off. 413 is in.\u0022\n\nACA was the Attitude Control Assembly\u2014the LM\u0027s control stick. Output went to the LGC to command the reaction control system jets to fire. \u0022Out of Detent\u0022 meant the stick had moved away from its centered position; it was spring-centered like the turn indicator in a car. Address 413 of the Abort Guidance System contained the variable that indicated the LM had landed.\nEagle landed at 20:17:40 UTC on Sunday July 20 with 216 pounds of usable fuel remaining. Information available to the crew and mission controllers during the landing showed the LM had enough fuel for another 25 seconds of powered flight before an abort without touchdown would have become unsafe, but post-mission analysis showed that the real figure was probably closer to 50 seconds. Apollo 11 landed with less fuel than most subsequent missions, and the astronauts encountered a premature low fuel warning. This was later found to be the result of the propellant sloshing more than expected, uncovering a fuel sensor. On subsequent missions, extra anti-slosh baffles were added to the tanks to prevent this.\nArmstrong acknowledged Aldrin\u0027s completion of the post-landing checklist with \u0022Engine arm is off\u0022, before responding to the CAPCOM, Charles Duke, with the words, \u0022Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.\u0022 Armstrong\u0027s unrehearsed change of call sign from \u0022Eagle\u0022 to \u0022Tranquility Base\u0022 emphasized to listeners that landing was complete and successful. Duke expressed the relief at Mission Control: \u0022Roger, Twan\u2014Tranquility, we copy you on the ground. You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue. We\u0027re breathing again. Thanks a lot.\u0022\n\nTwo and a half hours after landing, before preparations began for the EVA, Aldrin radioed to Earth:\n\nThis is the LM pilot. I\u0027d like to take this opportunity to ask every person listening in, whoever and wherever they may be, to pause for a moment and contemplate the events of the past few hours and to give thanks in his or her own way.\nHe then took communion privately. At this time NASA was still fighting a lawsuit brought by atheist Madalyn Murray O\u0027Hair demanding that their astronauts refrain from broadcasting religious activities while in space. For this reason, Aldrin chose to refrain from directly mentioning taking communion on the Moon. Aldrin was an elder at the Webster Presbyterian Church, and his communion kit was prepared by the pastor of the church, Dean Woodruff. Webster Presbyterian possesses the chalice used on the Moon and commemorates the event each year on the Sunday closest to July 20. The schedule for the mission called for the astronauts to follow the landing with a five-hour sleep period, but they chose to begin preparations for the EVA early, thinking they would be unable to sleep.\n\n\n=== Lunar surface operations ===\nPreparations for Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin to walk on the Moon began at 23:43 UTC. These took longer than expected; three and a half hours instead of two. During training on Earth, everything required had been neatly laid out in advance, but on the Moon the cabin contained a large number of other items as well, such as checklists, food packets, and tools. Six hours and thirty-nine minutes after landing, Armstrong and Aldrin were ready to go outside, and Eagle was depressurized.\nEagle\u0027s hatch was opened at 02:39:33. Armstrong initially had some difficulties squeezing through the hatch with his portable life support system . Some of the highest heart rates recorded from Apollo astronauts occurred during LM egress and ingress. At 02:51 Armstrong began his descent to the lunar surface. The remote-control unit on his chest kept him from seeing his feet. Climbing down the nine-rung ladder, Armstrong pulled a D-ring to deploy the modular equipment stowage assembly folded against Eagle\u0027s side and activate the TV camera.\nApollo 11 used slow-scan television incompatible with broadcast TV, so it was displayed on a special monitor and a conventional TV camera viewed this monitor , significantly reducing the quality of the picture. The signal was received at Goldstone in the United States, but with better fidelity by Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station near Canberra in Australia. Minutes later the feed was switched to the more sensitive Parkes radio telescope in Australia. Despite some technical and weather difficulties, black and white images of the first lunar EVA were received and broadcast to at least 600 million people on Earth. Copies of this video in broadcast format were saved and are widely available, but recordings of the original slow scan source transmission from the lunar surface were likely destroyed during routine magnetic tape re-use at NASA.\n\nAfter describing the surface dust as \u0022very fine-grained\u0022 and \u0022almost like a powder\u0022, at 02:56:15, six and a half hours after landing, Armstrong stepped off Eagle\u0027s landing pad and declared: \u0022That\u0027s one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\u0022\nArmstrong intended to say \u0022That\u0027s one small step for a man\u0022, but the word \u0022a\u0022 is not audible in the transmission, and thus was not initially reported by most observers of the live broadcast. When later asked about his quote, Armstrong said he believed he said \u0022for a man\u0022, and subsequent printed versions of the quote included the \u0022a\u0022 in square brackets. One explanation for the absence may be that his accent caused him to slur the words \u0022for a\u0022 together; another is the intermittent nature of the audio and video links to Earth, partly because of storms near Parkes Observatory. A more recent digital analysis of the tape claims to reveal the \u0022a\u0022 may have been spoken but obscured by static. Other analysis points to the claims of static and slurring as \u0022face-saving fabrication\u0022, and that Armstrong himself later admitted to misspeaking the line.\nAbout seven minutes after stepping onto the Moon\u0027s surface, Armstrong collected a contingency soil sample using a sample bag on a stick. He then folded the bag and tucked it into a pocket on his right thigh. This was to guarantee there would be some lunar soil brought back in case an emergency required the astronauts to abandon the EVA and return to the LM. Twelve minutes after the sample was collected, he removed the TV camera from the MESA and made a panoramic sweep, then mounted it on a tripod. The TV camera cable remained partly coiled and presented a tripping hazard throughout the EVA. Still photography was accomplished with a Hasselblad camera that could be operated hand-held or mounted on Armstrong\u0027s Apollo space suit. Aldrin joined Armstrong on the surface. He described the view with the simple phrase: \u0022Magnificent desolation.\u0022\nArmstrong said moving in the lunar gravity, one-sixth of Earth\u0027s, was \u0022even perhaps easier than the simulations ... It\u0027s absolutely no trouble to walk around.\u0022 Aldrin joined him on the surface and tested methods for moving around, including two-footed kangaroo hops. The PLSS backpack created a tendency to tip backward, but neither astronaut had serious problems maintaining balance. Loping became the preferred method of movement. The astronauts reported that they needed to plan their movements six or seven steps ahead. The fine soil was quite slippery. Aldrin remarked that moving from sunlight into Eagle\u0027s shadow produced no temperature change inside the suit, but the helmet was warmer in sunlight, so he felt cooler in shadow. The MESA failed to provide a stable work platform and was in shadow, slowing work somewhat. As they worked, the moonwalkers kicked up gray dust, which soiled the outer part of their suits.\n\nThe astronauts planted the Lunar Flag Assembly containing a flag of the United States on the lunar surface, in clear view of the TV camera. Aldrin remembered, \u0022Of all the jobs I had to do on the Moon the one I wanted to go the smoothest was the flag raising.\u0022 But the astronauts struggled with the telescoping rod and could only insert the pole about 2 inches into the hard lunar surface. Aldrin was afraid it might topple in front of TV viewers, but gave \u0022a crisp West Point salute\u0022. Before Aldrin could take a photo of Armstrong with the flag, President Richard Nixon spoke to them through a telephone-radio transmission, which Nixon called \u0022the most historic phone call ever made from the White House.\u0022 Nixon originally had a long speech prepared to read during the phone call, but Frank Borman, who was at the White House as a NASA liaison during Apollo 11, convinced Nixon to keep his words brief.\n\nNixon: Hello, Neil and Buzz. I\u0027m talking to you by telephone from the Oval Room at the White House. And this certainly has to be the most historic telephone call ever made from the White House. I just can\u0027t tell you how proud we all are of what you have done. For every American, this has to be the proudest day of our lives. And for people all over the world, I am sure that they too join with Americans in recognizing what an immense feat this is. Because of what you have done, the heavens have become a part of man\u0027s world. And as you talk to us from the Sea of Tranquility, it inspires us to redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquility to Earth. For one priceless moment in the whole history of man, all the people on this Earth are truly one: one in their pride in what you have done, and one in our prayers that you will return safely to Earth.\nArmstrong: Thank you, Mr. President. It\u0027s a great honor and privilege for us to be here, representing not only the United States, but men of peace of all nations, and with interest and a curiosity, and men with a vision for the future. It\u0027s an honor for us to be able to participate here today.\n\nNixon: Thank you very much, and I look forward, all of us look forward, to seeing you on the Hornet on Thursday.\n\nThey deployed the EASEP, which included a Passive Seismic Experiment Package used to measure moonquakes and a retroreflector array used for the lunar laser ranging experiment. Then Armstrong walked 196 feet from the LM to take photographs at the rim of Little West Crater while Aldrin collected two core samples. He used the geologist\u0027s hammer to pound in the tubes\u2014the only time the hammer was used on Apollo 11\u2014but was unable to penetrate more than 6 inches deep. The astronauts then collected rock samples using scoops and tongs on extension handles. Many of the surface activities took longer than expected, so they had to stop documenting sample collection halfway through the allotted 34 minutes. Aldrin shoveled 6 kilograms of soil into the box of rocks to pack them in tightly. Two types of rocks were found in the geological samples: basalt and breccia. Three new minerals were discovered in the rock samples collected by the astronauts: armalcolite, tranquillityite, and pyroxferroite. Armalcolite was named after Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins. All have subsequently been found on Earth.\n\nWhile on the surface, Armstrong uncovered a plaque mounted on the LM ladder, bearing two drawings of Earth , an inscription, and signatures of the astronauts and President Nixon. The inscription read:\n\nHere men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon July 1969, A. D. We came in peace for all mankind.\nAt the behest of the Nixon administration to add a reference to God, NASA included the vague date as a reason to include A.D., which stands for Anno Domini .\nMission Control used a coded phrase to warn Armstrong his metabolic rates were high, and that he should slow down. He was moving rapidly from task to task as time ran out. As metabolic rates remained generally lower than expected for both astronauts throughout the walk, Mission Control granted the astronauts a 15-minute extension. In a 2010 interview, Armstrong explained that NASA limited the first moonwalk\u0027s time and distance because there was no empirical proof of how much cooling water the astronauts\u0027 PLSS backpacks would consume to handle their body heat generation while working on the Moon.\n\n\n=== Lunar ascent ===\nAldrin entered Eagle first. With some difficulty the astronauts lifted film and two sample boxes containing 21.55 kilograms of lunar surface material to the LM hatch using a flat cable pulley device called the Lunar Equipment Conveyor . This proved to be an inefficient tool, and later missions preferred to carry equipment and samples up to the LM by hand. Armstrong reminded Aldrin of a bag of memorial items in his sleeve pocket, and Aldrin tossed the bag down. Armstrong then jumped onto the ladder\u0027s third rung, and climbed into the LM. After transferring to LM life support, the explorers lightened the ascent stage for the return to lunar orbit by tossing out their PLSS backpacks, lunar overshoes, an empty Hasselblad camera, and other equipment. The hatch was closed again at 05:11:13. They then pressurized the LM and settled down to sleep.\n\nPresidential speech writer William Safire had prepared an In Event of Moon Disaster announcement for Nixon to read in the event the Apollo 11 astronauts were stranded on the Moon. The remarks were in a memo from Safire to Nixon\u0027s White House Chief of Staff H. R. Haldeman, in which Safire suggested a protocol the administration might follow in reaction to such a disaster. According to the plan, Mission Control would \u0022close down communications\u0022 with the LM, and a clergyman would \u0022commend their souls to the deepest of the deep\u0022 in a public ritual likened to burial at sea. The last line of the prepared text contained an allusion to Rupert Brooke\u0027s World War I poem \u0022The Soldier\u0022. The script for the speech does not make reference to Collins; as he remained onboard Columbia in orbit around the Moon, it was expected that he would be able to return the module to Earth in the event of a mission failure.\nWhile moving inside the cabin, Aldrin accidentally damaged the circuit breaker that would arm the main engine for liftoff from the Moon. There was a concern this would prevent firing the engine, stranding them on the Moon. The nonconductive tip of a Duro felt-tip pen was sufficient to activate the switch.\nAfter more than 21\u002B1\u20442 hours on the lunar surface, in addition to the scientific instruments, the astronauts left behind: an Apollo 1 mission patch in memory of astronauts Roger Chaffee, Gus Grissom, and Edward White, who died when their command module caught fire during a test in January 1967; two memorial medals of Soviet cosmonauts Vladimir Komarov and Yuri Gagarin, who died in 1967 and 1968 respectively; a memorial bag containing a gold replica of an olive branch as a traditional symbol of peace; and a silicon message disk carrying the goodwill statements by presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon along with messages from leaders of 73 countries around the world. The disk also carries a listing of the leadership of the US Congress, a listing of members of the four committees of the House and Senate responsible for the NASA legislation, and the names of NASA\u0027s past and then-current top management.\n\nAfter about seven hours of rest, the crew was awakened by Houston to prepare for the return flight. \nAt that time, unknown to them, some hundred kilometers away from them the Soviet probe Luna 15 was about to descend and impact. Despite having been known to be orbiting the Moon at the same time, through a ground-breaking precautious goodwill exchange of data, the mission control of Luna 15 unexpectedly hastened its robotic sample-return mission, initiating descent, in an attempt to return before Apollo 11. Just two hours before Apollo 11\u0027s launch Luna 15 crashed at 15:50 UTC, with British astronomers monitoring Luna 15 and recording the situation one commented: \u0022I say, this has really been drama of the highest order\u0022, bringing the Space Race to a culmination.\nRoughly two hours later, at 17:54:00 UTC, the Apollo 11 crew on the surface safely lifted off in Eagle\u0027s ascent stage to rejoin Collins aboard Columbia in lunar orbit. Film taken from the LM ascent stage upon liftoff from the Moon reveals the American flag, planted some 25 feet from the descent stage, whipping violently in the exhaust of the ascent stage engine. Aldrin looked up in time to witness the flag topple: \u0022The ascent stage of the LM separated ... I was concentrating on the computers, and Neil was studying the attitude indicator, but I looked up long enough to see the flag fall over.\u0022 Subsequent Apollo missions planted their flags farther from the LM.\n\n\n=== Columbia in lunar orbit ===\nDuring his day flying solo around the Moon, Collins never felt lonely. Although it has been said \u0022not since Adam has any human known such solitude\u0022, Collins felt very much a part of the mission. In his autobiography he wrote: \u0022this venture has been structured for three men, and I consider my third to be as necessary as either of the other two\u0022. In the 48 minutes of each orbit when he was out of radio contact with the Earth while Columbia passed round the far side of the Moon, the feeling he reported was not fear or loneliness, but rather \u0022awareness, anticipation, satisfaction, confidence, almost exultation\u0022.\nOne of Collins\u0027 first tasks was to identify the Lunar Module on the ground. To give Collins an idea where to look, Mission Control radioed that they believed the Lunar Module landed about 4 miles off target. Each time he passed over the suspected lunar landing site, he tried in vain to find the module. On his first orbits on the back side of the Moon, Collins performed maintenance activities such as dumping excess water produced by the fuel cells and preparing the cabin for Armstrong and Aldrin to return.\nJust before he reached the dark side on the third orbit, Mission Control informed Collins there was a problem with the temperature of the coolant. If it became too cold, parts of Columbia might freeze. Mission Control advised him to assume manual control and implement Environmental Control System Malfunction Procedure 17. Instead, Collins flicked the switch on the system from automatic to manual and back to automatic again, and carried on with normal housekeeping chores, while keeping an eye on the temperature. When Columbia came back around to the near side of the Moon again, he was able to report that the problem had been resolved. For the next couple of orbits, he described his time on the back side of the Moon as \u0022relaxing\u0022. After Aldrin and Armstrong completed their EVA, Collins slept so he could be rested for the rendezvous. While the flight plan called for Eagle to meet up with Columbia, Collins was prepared for a contingency in which he would fly Columbia down to meet Eagle.\n\n\n=== Return ===\n\nEagle rendezvoused with Columbia at 21:24 UTC on July 21, and the two docked at 21:35. Eagle\u0027s ascent stage was jettisoned into lunar orbit at 23:41. Just before the Apollo 12 flight, it was noted that Eagle was still likely to be orbiting the Moon. Later NASA reports mentioned that Eagle\u0027s orbit had decayed, resulting in it impacting in an \u0022uncertain location\u0022 on the lunar surface. In 2021, however, some calculations show that the lander may still be in orbit.\nOn July 23, the last night before splashdown, the three astronauts made a television broadcast in which Collins commented: \u0022All this is possible only through the blood, sweat, and tears of a number of people ... All you see is the three of us, but beneath the surface are thousands and thousands of others, and to all of those, I would like to say, \u0027Thank you very much\u0027.\u0022 Aldrin added: \u0022This has been far more than three men on a mission to the Moon; more, still, than the efforts of a government and industry team; more, even, than the efforts of one nation. We feel that this stands as a symbol of the insatiable curiosity of all mankind to explore the unknown ...\u0022\nArmstrong concluded:\n\nThe responsibility for this flight lies first with history and with the giants of science who have preceded this effort; next with the American people, who have, through their will, indicated their desire; next with four administrations and their Congresses, for implementing that will; and then, with the agency and industry teams that built our spacecraft, the Saturn, the Columbia, the Eagle, and the little EMU, the spacesuit and backpack that was our small spacecraft out on the lunar surface. We would like to give special thanks to all those Americans who built the spacecraft; who did the construction, design, the tests, and put their hearts and all their abilities into those craft. To those people tonight, we give a special thank you, and to all the other people that are listening and watching tonight, God bless you. Good night from Apollo 11. \nOn the return to Earth, a bearing at the Guam tracking station failed, potentially preventing communication on the last segment of the Earth return. A regular repair was not possible in the available time but the station director, Charles Force, had his ten-year-old son Greg use his small hands to reach into the housing and pack it with grease. Greg was later thanked by Armstrong.\n\n\n=== Splashdown and quarantine ===\n\nThe aircraft carrier USS Hornet, under the command of Captain Carl J. Seiberlich, was selected as the primary recovery ship for Apollo 11 on June 5, replacing her sister ship, the LPH USS Princeton, which had recovered Apollo 10 on May 26. Hornet was then at her home port of Long Beach, California. On reaching Pearl Harbor on July 5, Hornet embarked the Sikorsky SH-3 Sea King helicopters of HS-4, a unit which specialized in recovery of Apollo spacecraft, specialized divers of UDT Detachment Apollo, a 35-man NASA recovery team, and about 120 media representatives. To make room, most of Hornet\u0027s air wing was left behind in Long Beach. Special recovery equipment was also loaded, including a boilerplate command module used for training.\nOn July 12, with Apollo 11 still on the launch pad, Hornet departed Pearl Harbor for the recovery area in the central Pacific, in the vicinity of 10\u00B036\u2032N 172\u00B024\u2032E. A presidential party consisting of Nixon, Borman, Secretary of State William P. Rogers and National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger flew to Johnston Atoll on Air Force One, then to the command ship USS Arlington in Marine One. After a night on board, they would fly to Hornet in Marine One for a few hours of ceremonies. On arrival aboard Hornet, the party was greeted by the Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Command , Admiral John S. McCain Jr., and NASA Administrator Thomas O. Paine, who flew to Hornet from Pago Pago in one of Hornet\u0027s carrier onboard delivery aircraft.\nWeather satellites were not yet common, but US Air Force Captain Hank Brandli had access to top-secret spy satellite images. He realized that a storm front was headed for the Apollo recovery area. Poor visibility which could make locating the capsule difficult, and strong upper-level winds which \u0022would have ripped their parachutes to shreds\u0022 according to Brandli, posed a serious threat to the safety of the mission. Brandli alerted Navy Captain Willard S. Houston Jr., the commander of the Fleet Weather Center at Pearl Harbor, who had the required security clearance. On their recommendation, Rear Admiral Donald C. Davis, commander of Manned Spaceflight Recovery Forces, Pacific, advised NASA to change the recovery area, each man risking his career. A new location was selected 215 nautical miles northeast.\nThis altered the flight plan. A different sequence of computer programs was used, one never before attempted. In a conventional entry, trajectory event P64 was followed by P67. For a skip-out re-entry, P65 and P66 were employed to handle the exit and entry parts of the skip. In this case, because they were extending the re-entry but not actually skipping out, P66 was not invoked and instead, P65 led directly to P67. The crew were also warned they would not be in a full-lift attitude when they entered P67. The first program\u0027s acceleration subjected the astronauts to 6.5 standard gravities ; the second, to 6.0 standard gravities .\nBefore dawn on July 24, Hornet launched four Sea King helicopters and three Grumman E-1 Tracers. Two of the E-1s were designated as \u0022air boss\u0022 while the third acted as a communications relay aircraft. Two of the Sea Kings carried divers and recovery equipment. The third carried photographic equipment, and the fourth carried the decontamination swimmer and the flight surgeon. At 16:44 UTC Columbia\u0027s drogue parachutes were deployed. This was observed by the helicopters. Seven minutes later Columbia struck the water forcefully 2,660 km east of Wake Island, 380 km south of Johnston Atoll, and 24 km from Hornet, at 13\u00B019\u2032N 169\u00B09\u2032W. 82 \u00B0F with 6 feet seas and winds at 17 knots from the east were reported under broken clouds at 1,500 feet with visibility of 10 nautical miles at the recovery site. Reconnaissance aircraft flying to the original splashdown location reported the conditions Brandli and Houston had predicted.\nDuring splashdown, Columbia landed upside down but was righted within ten minutes by flotation bags activated by the astronauts. A diver from the Navy helicopter hovering above attached a sea anchor to prevent it from drifting. More divers attached flotation collars to stabilize the module and positioned rafts for astronaut extraction.\n\nThe divers then passed biological isolation garments to the astronauts, and assisted them into the life raft. The possibility of bringing back pathogens from the lunar surface was considered remote, but NASA took precautions at the recovery site. The astronauts were rubbed down with a sodium hypochlorite solution and Columbia wiped with Povidone-iodine to remove any lunar dust that might be present. The astronauts were winched on board the recovery helicopter. BIGs were worn until they reached isolation facilities on board Hornet. The raft containing decontamination materials was intentionally sunk.\nAfter touchdown on Hornet at 17:53 UTC, the helicopter was lowered by the elevator into the hangar bay, where the astronauts walked the 30 feet to the mobile quarantine facility , where they would begin the Earth-based portion of their 21 days of quarantine. This practice would continue for two more Apollo missions, Apollo 12 and Apollo 14, before the Moon was proven to be barren of life, and the quarantine process dropped. Nixon welcomed the astronauts back to Earth. He told them: \u0022[A]s a result of what you\u0027ve done, the world has never been closer together before.\u0022\nAfter Nixon departed, Hornet was brought alongside the 5-short-ton Columbia, which was lifted aboard by the ship\u0027s crane, placed on a dolly and moved next to the MQF. It was then attached to the MQF with a flexible tunnel, allowing the lunar samples, film, data tapes and other items to be removed. Hornet returned to Pearl Harbor, where the MQF was loaded onto a Lockheed C-141 Starlifter and airlifted to the Manned Spacecraft Center. The astronauts arrived at the Lunar Receiving Laboratory at 10:00 UTC on July 28. Columbia was taken to Ford Island for deactivation, and its pyrotechnics made safe. It was then taken to Hickham Air Force Base, from whence it was flown to Houston in a Douglas C-133 Cargomaster, reaching the Lunar Receiving Laboratory on July 30.\nIn accordance with the Extra-Terrestrial Exposure Law, a set of regulations promulgated by NASA on July 16 to codify its quarantine protocol, the astronauts continued in quarantine. After three weeks in confinement , the astronauts were given a clean bill of health. On August 10, 1969, the Interagency Committee on Back Contamination met in Atlanta and lifted the quarantine on the astronauts, on those who had joined them in quarantine , and on Columbia itself. Loose equipment from the spacecraft remained in isolation until the lunar samples were released for study.\r\n\r\n== Celebrations ==\nFollowing their return to Earth, the Apollo 11 crew received widespread international acclaim. On August 13, 1969, astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins were honored with ticker-tape parades in New York City and Chicago, with an estimated six million people lining the streets. That evening, a state dinner was held in Los Angeles at the Century Plaza Hotel to commemorate the historic achievement. The event was attended by members of Congress, 44 state governors, Chief Justice of the United States Warren E. Burger and his predecessor Earl Warren, as well as ambassadors from 83 nations. President Richard Nixon and Vice President Spiro Agnew awarded each astronaut the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor in the United States.\n\nOn September 16, the astronauts addressed a joint session of Congress, where they presented two American flags\u2014one to the House of Representatives and one to the Senate\u2014that had traveled to the lunar surface aboard Eagle.\nOne of the mission flags carried aboard the flight\u2014the Flag of American Samoa\u2014was later displayed at the Jean P. Haydon Museum in Pago Pago, the capital of American Samoa, recognizing the territory\u2019s support role as a recovery staging area.\n\nThe celebrations continued with a 38-day world goodwill tour titled \u201CGiant Leap\u201D, which began on September 29 and concluded on November 5, 1969. The astronauts visited 22 countries and met with numerous heads of state, prime ministers, royalty, and civic leaders. The tour, intended to thank the international community for their support of the space program, began in Mexico City and ended in Tokyo. Notable stops included Bogot\u00E1, Buenos Aires, Rio de Janeiro, Madrid, Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels, London, Rome, Belgrade, Tehran, Mumbai, Bangkok, Sydney, Guam, and Honolulu. Crowds in the tens or hundreds of thousands gathered to greet the astronauts in each city.\nNumerous countries and organizations honored the Moon landing by issuing special commemorative items. These included postage stamps, coins, medals, plaques, and magazine features. TIME, National Geographic, LIFE, and dozens of international publications featured the astronauts on their covers. Many of these commemoratives are now held in public and private collections, and some were placed aboard later Apollo missions in symbolic tribute.\nAdditionally, the success of Apollo 11 contributed to a brief spike in interest in science and technology education, often referred to as the \u201CApollo effect,\u201D influencing a generation of engineers and scientists.\r\n\r\n== 8-Day NASA Mission timeline [9-Days] ==\r\n\r\n== Legacy ==\n\n\n=== Cultural significance ===\n\nHumans walking on the Moon and returning safely to Earth accomplished Kennedy\u0027s goal set eight years earlier. In Mission Control during the Apollo 11 landing, Kennedy\u0027s speech flashed on the screen, followed by the words \u0022TASK ACCOMPLISHED, July 1969\u0022. The success of Apollo 11 demonstrated the United States\u0027 technological superiority; and with the success of Apollo 11, America had won the Space Race.\nNew phrases permeated into the English language. \u0022If they can send a man to the Moon, why can\u0027t they ...?\u0022 became a common saying following Apollo 11. Armstrong\u0027s words on the lunar surface also spun off various parodies.\nWhile most people celebrated the accomplishment, disenfranchised Americans saw it as a symbol of the divide in America, evidenced by protesters led by Ralph Abernathy outside of Kennedy Space Center the day before Apollo 11 launched. NASA Administrator Thomas Paine met with Abernathy at the occasion, both hoping that the space program can spur progress also in other regards, such as poverty in the US. Paine was then asked, and agreed, to host protesters as spectators at the launch, and Abernathy, awestruck by the spectacle, prayed for the astronauts. Racial and financial inequalities frustrated citizens who wondered why money spent on the Apollo program was not spent taking care of humans on Earth. A poem by Gil Scott-Heron called \u0022Whitey on the Moon\u0022 illustrated the racial inequality in the United States that was highlighted by the Space Race. The poem starts with:\n\nTwenty percent of the world\u0027s population watched humans walk on the Moon for the first time. While Apollo 11 sparked the interest of the world, the follow-on Apollo missions did not hold the interest of the nation. One possible explanation was the shift in complexity. Landing someone on the Moon was an easy goal to understand; lunar geology was too abstract for the average person. Another is that Kennedy\u0027s goal of landing humans on the Moon had already been accomplished. A well-defined objective helped Project Apollo accomplish its goal, but after it was completed it was hard to justify continuing the lunar missions.\nWhile most Americans were proud of their nation\u0027s achievements in space exploration, only once during the late 1960s did the Gallup Poll indicate that a majority of Americans favored \u0022doing more\u0022 in space as opposed to \u0022doing less\u0022. By 1973, 59 percent of those polled favored cutting spending on space exploration. The Space Race had been won, and Cold War tensions were easing as the US and Soviet Union entered the era of d\u00E9tente. This was also a time when inflation was rising, which put pressure on the government to reduce spending. The space program was saved due to the perception that it was one of the few government programs that had achieved something great. Drastic cuts, warned Caspar Weinberger, the deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget, might send a signal that \u0022our best years are behind us\u0022.\nAfter the Apollo 11 mission, officials from the Soviet Union said landing humans on the Moon was dangerous and unnecessary. At the time the Soviet Union was attempting to retrieve lunar samples robotically. The Soviets publicly denied there was a race to the Moon, and indicated they were not making an attempt. Mstislav Keldysh said in July 1969, \u0022We are concentrating wholly on the creation of large satellite systems.\u0022 It was revealed in 1989 that the Soviets had tried to send people to the Moon, but were unable due to technological difficulties. The public\u0027s reaction in the Soviet Union was mixed. The Soviet government limited the release of information about the lunar landing, which affected the reaction. A portion of the populace did not give it any attention, and another portion was angered by it.\nThe Apollo 11 landing is referenced in the songs \u0022Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins\u0022 by the Byrds on the 1969 album Ballad of Easy Rider, \u0022Coon on the Moon\u0022 by Howlin\u0027 Wolf on the 1973 album The Back Door Wolf, and \u0022One Small Step\u0022 by Ayreon on the 2000 album Universal Migrator Part 1: The Dream Sequencer.\n\n\n=== Spacecraft ===\n\nThe command module Columbia went on a tour of the United States, visiting 49 state capitals, the District of Columbia, and Anchorage, Alaska. In 1971, it was transferred to the Smithsonian Institution, and was displayed at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, DC. It was in the central Milestones of Flight exhibition hall in front of the Jefferson Drive entrance, sharing the main hall with other pioneering flight vehicles such as the Wright Flyer, Spirit of St. Louis, Bell X-1, North American X-15 and Friendship 7.\nColumbia was moved in 2017 to the NASM Mary Baker Engen Restoration Hangar at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia, to be readied for a four-city tour titled Destination Moon: The Apollo 11 Mission. This included Space Center Houston from October 14, 2017, to March 18, 2018, the Saint Louis Science Center from April 14 to September 3, 2018, the Senator John Heinz History Center in Pittsburgh from September 29, 2018, to February 18, 2019, and its last location at Museum of Flight in Seattle from March 16 to September 2, 2019. Continued renovations at the Smithsonian allowed time for an additional stop for the capsule, and it was moved to the Cincinnati Museum Center. The ribbon cutting ceremony was on September 29, 2019.\nFor 40 years Armstrong\u0027s and Aldrin\u0027s space suits were displayed in the museum\u0027s Apollo to the Moon exhibit, until it permanently closed on December 3, 2018, to be replaced by a new gallery which was scheduled to open in 2022. A special display of Armstrong\u0027s suit was unveiled for the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11 in July 2019. The quarantine trailer, the flotation collar and the flotation bags are in the Smithsonian\u0027s Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center annex near Washington Dulles International Airport in Chantilly, Virginia, where they are on display along with a test lunar module.\n\nThe descent stage of the LM Eagle remains on the Moon. In 2009, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter imaged the various Apollo landing sites on the surface of the Moon, for the first time with sufficient resolution to see the descent stages of the lunar modules, scientific instruments, and foot trails made by the astronauts. \nThe remains of the ascent stage are assumed to lie at an unknown location on the lunar surface. The ascent stage,  Eagle, was not tracked after it was jettisoned.  The lunar gravity field is sufficiently non-uniform to make low Moon orbits unstable after a short time, leading the orbiting object to impact the surface. However, using a program developed by NASA, and high-resolution lunar gravity data, a paper was published, in 2021, indicating that Eagle might still be in orbit as late as 2020. Using the orbital elements published by NASA, a Monte Carlo method was used to generate parameter sets that bracket the uncertainties in these elements. All simulations, of the orbit, predicted that Eagle would never impact the lunar surface.\n\nIn March 2012 a team of specialists financed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos located the F-1 engines from the S-IC stage that launched Apollo 11 into space. They were found on the Atlantic seabed using advanced sonar scanning. His team brought parts of two of the five engines to the surface. In July 2013, a conservator discovered a serial number under the rust on one of the engines raised from the Atlantic, which NASA confirmed was from Apollo 11. The S-IVB third stage which performed Apollo 11\u0027s trans-lunar injection remains in a solar orbit near to that of Earth.\n\n\n=== Moon rocks ===\nThe main repository for the Apollo Moon rocks is the Lunar Sample Laboratory Facility at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. For safekeeping, there is also a smaller collection stored at White Sands Test Facility near Las Cruces, New Mexico. Most of the rocks are stored in nitrogen to keep them free of moisture. They are handled only indirectly, using special tools. Over 100 research laboratories worldwide conduct studies of the samples; approximately 500 samples are prepared and sent to investigators every year.\nIn November 1969, Nixon asked NASA to make up about 250 presentation Apollo 11 lunar sample displays for 135 nations, the fifty states of the United States and its possessions, and the United Nations. Each display included Moon dust from Apollo 11 and flags, including one of the Soviet Union, taken along by Apollo 11. The rice-sized particles were four small pieces of Moon soil weighing about 50 mg and were enveloped in a clear acrylic button about as big as a United States half-dollar coin. This acrylic button magnified the grains of lunar dust. Nixon gave the Apollo 11 lunar sample displays as goodwill gifts in 1970.\n\n\n=== Experiment results ===\nThe Passive Seismic Experiment ran until the command uplink failed on August 25, 1969. The downlink failed on December 14, 1969. As of 2018, the Lunar Laser Ranging experiment remains operational.\n\n\n=== Moonwalk camera ===\nThe Hasselblad camera used during the moonwalk was thought to be lost or left on the Moon surface.\n\n\n=== Lunar Module Eagle memorabilia ===\nIn 2015, after Armstrong died in 2012, his widow contacted the National Air and Space Museum to inform them she had found a white cloth bag in one of Armstrong\u0027s closets. The bag contained various items, which should have been left behind in the Lunar Module Eagle, including the 16mm Data Acquisition Camera that had been used to capture images of the first Moon landing. The camera is currently on display at the National Air and Space Museum.\n\n\n=== Anniversary events ===\n\n\n==== 40th anniversary ====\n\nOn July 15, 2009, Life.com released a photo gallery of previously unpublished photos of the astronauts taken by Life photographer Ralph Morse prior to the Apollo 11 launch. From July 16 to 24, 2009, NASA streamed the original mission audio on its website in real time 40 years to the minute after the events occurred. It is in the process of restoring the video footage and has released a preview of key moments. In July 2010, air-to-ground voice recordings and film footage shot in Mission Control during the Apollo 11 powered descent and landing was re-synchronized and released for the first time. The John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum set up an Adobe Flash website that rebroadcasts the transmissions of Apollo 11 from launch to landing on the Moon.\nOn July 20, 2009, Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins met with President Barack Obama at the White House. \u0022We expect that there is, as we speak, another generation of kids out there who are looking up at the sky and are going to be the next Armstrong, Collins, and Aldrin\u0022, Obama said. \u0022We want to make sure that NASA is going to be there for them when they want to take their journey.\u0022 On August 7, 2009, an act of Congress awarded the three astronauts a Congressional Gold Medal, the highest civilian award in the United States. The bill was sponsored by Florida Senator Bill Nelson and Florida Representative Alan Grayson.\nA group of British scientists interviewed as part of the anniversary events reflected on the significance of the Moon landing:\n\nIt was carried out in a technically brilliant way with risks taken ... that would be inconceivable in the risk-averse world of today ... The Apollo programme is arguably the greatest technical achievement of mankind to date ... nothing since Apollo has come close [to] the excitement that was generated by those astronauts\u2014Armstrong, Aldrin and the 10 others who followed them.\n\n\n==== 50th anniversary ====\n\nOn June 10, 2015, Congressman Bill Posey introduced resolution H.R. 2726 to the 114th session of the United States House of Representatives directing the United States Mint to design and sell commemorative coins in gold, silver and clad for the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission. On January 24, 2019, the Mint released the Apollo 11 Fiftieth Anniversary commemorative coins to the public on its website.\nA documentary film, Apollo 11, with restored footage of the 1969 event, premiered in IMAX on March 1, 2019, and broadly in theaters on March 8.\nThe Smithsonian Institute\u0027s National Air and Space Museum and NASA sponsored the \u0022Apollo 50 Festival\u0022 on the National Mall in Washington DC. The three-day outdoor festival featured hands-on exhibits and activities, live performances, and speakers such as Adam Savage and NASA scientists.\n\nAs part of the festival, a projection of the 363-foot tall Saturn V rocket was displayed on the east face of the 555-foot tall Washington Monument from July 16 through the 20th from 9:30 pm until 11:30 pm . The program also included a 17-minute show that combined full-motion video projected on the Washington Monument to recreate the assembly and launch of the Saturn V rocket. The projection was joined by a 40-foot wide recreation of the Kennedy Space Center countdown clock and two large video screens showing archival footage to recreate the time leading up to the moon landing. There were three shows per night on July 19\u201320, with the last show on Saturday, delayed slightly so the portion where Armstrong first set foot on the Moon would happen exactly 50 years to the second after the actual event.\nOn July 19, 2019, the Google Doodle paid tribute to the Apollo 11 Moon landing, complete with a link to an animated YouTube video with voiceover by astronaut Michael Collins.\nAldrin, Collins, and Armstrong\u0027s sons were hosted by President Donald Trump in the Oval Office.\r\n\r\n== Films and documentaries ==\nFootprints on the Moon, a 1969 documentary film by Bill Gibson and Barry Coe\nMoonwalk One, a 1971 documentary film by Theo Kamecke\nApollo 11: As It Happened, a 1994 six-hour documentary on ABC News\u0027 coverage of the event\nFirst Man, 2018 film by Damien Chazelle based on the 2005 James R.
