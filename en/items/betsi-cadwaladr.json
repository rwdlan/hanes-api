  "wikiArticle": "Betsi Cadwaladr , also known as Beti Cadwaladr, Betsi Davis, and Elizabeth Davis, was a Welsh nurse. She began nursing on travelling ships in her 30s and later nursed in the Crimean War alongside Florence Nightingale.\nHer name today is synonymous with the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board , the largest health organisation in Wales. In 2016, she was named as one of \u0022the 50 greatest Welsh men and women of all time\u0022 \nOne of the few sources for her life is the book \u0027Autobiography of Elizabeth Davis\u0027, published in 1857.  This was based on a series of interviews with the author Jane Williams  towards the end of Cadwaladr\u0027s life.\r\n\r\n== Background ==\nElizabeth \u0027Betsi\u0027 Cadwaladr was born in 1789 at Llanycil, near Bala, Wales, one of 16 children to Methodist preacher Dafydd Cadwaladr and his wife Judith.  She grew up on Pen Rhiw Farm, Llanycil.  Her mother died and was buried on 10 February 1800 when Betsi was ten years old.  In her interviews with Jane Williams, Betsi said she was given a copy of the Bible as a present from Thomas Charles , which she later reflected shaped her purpose to her life.\r\n\r\n== Her early work ==\nAccording to Jane Williams biography, Cadwaladr got employment locally as a maid at Plas yn Dre, where she learned housework, to speak English, and to play the triple harp. Cadwaladr was not happy there, though, and aged 14 she claimed to have escaped through a bedroom window using tied sheets, and left Bala. She then obtained employment as a domestic servant in Liverpool.\nAt some point in her life she changed her surname to Davis because it was easy to pronounce outside Wales.  She later returned to Wales, but subsequently fled to London to avoid marriage, living with her sister.  Here in London she first encountered the theatre, which became a great interest to her.\nWorking as a maid and assistant, Cadwaladr claimed she had the opportunity to travel widely around the world. She said she was in France at the time of the Battle of Waterloo, and visited the battlefield where she was moved by the plight of the injured. In 1820, aged 31, she again returned to Bala, which she now considered \u0027dull\u0027, so she became a maid to a ship\u0027s captain and said she travelled for years, visiting such places as South America, Africa and Australia. At times she performed Shakespeare on board ship, and met such people as William Carey, the missionary, and Bishop Heber, the hymn-writer.  More recently Gruffydd Jones has found little evidence to support all of Cadwaladr\u0027s claims about her travels.\nAt this time she was not trained in nursing, but during the course of her time on board ship she became involved in the care of the sick, and she also delivered babies. Despite her stubbornness and independence, Cadwaladr herself claimed that in the course of her travels she was proposed to by over 20 men.\r\n\r\n== Her work as a nurse ==\nOn returning to Britain, she worked at Guy\u0027s Hospital for \u2018perhaps a year\u2019 around 1850  Then at the age of 65 she was one of many women who applied to go to the Crimea to nurse the injured.   Her sister Bridget tried to dissuade her. Cadwaladr was interviewed by Mary Stanley and Elizabeth Herbert as by this time Florence Nightingale was already in Scutari. \nCadwaladr went to the Crimea in the second group of nurses led by Mary Stanley, November 1854.  Nightingale was not expecting this group of nurses and there was a delay of several weeks in allocating them roles.  Cadwaladr was one of the secular nurses were sent to Therapia until this was resolved.  Cadwaladr claims that she met Nightingale and frustrated by the delay said  \u0022Do you think I am a dog or an animal to make me over? I have a will of my own.\u0022\nCadwaladr was subsequently posted to a hospital in Scutari, Turkey, a hospital being run by Florence Nightingale. Cadwaladr worked there for some months, but there were frequent clashes between the two; they came from very different social backgrounds and were a generation apart in age .  Nightingale was a stickler for rules and bureaucracy, some of which she set up; indeed, she was also famed as a statistician. Cadwaladr often side-stepped regulations to react more intuitively to the ever-changing needs of the injured soldiers. Whilst Nightingale subsequently acknowledged Cadwaladr\u0027s work and the progress that she made against the unhygienic conditions, the two fell out to such a degree that Cadwaladr, by now aged over 65, moved by choice from the hospital, nearer to the frontline at Balaclava. Here, apart from her nursing work and her supervision of the camp kitchens, she again gained notoriety for her fight with bureaucracy to ensure that necessary supplies got through. Nightingale visited Balaclava twice and, on seeing the changes brought about by Cadwaladr\u0027s methods, gave her the credit she was due.\r\n\r\n== Death ==\n\nConditions in the Crimea eventually took their toll on Cadwaladr\u0027s health, as she was ill with cholera and dysentery when she returned to Britain in 1855, a year before the war ended. She lived in London, again at her sister\u0027s house, during which time she wrote her autobiography. She died in 1860, five years after her return, and was buried in the pauper\u0027s section of Abney Park Cemetery in north London. A new memorial stone was placed on her grave in August 2012.\r\n\r\n== Royal College of Nursing in Wales ==\nOn Nurses\u0027 Day 2005, as requested by the then RCN Welsh Board Chair, Eirlys Warrington, Donna M Mead addressed the Royal College of Nursing in Wales. The topic was \u2018Nursing, Now and Then\u2019. Inevitably, the accomplishments of nursing pioneers such as Florence Nightingale and Mary Seacole were mentioned. It was asserted that it was time that Wales acknowledged its own nursing heroine and Mead, supported by the Royal College of Nursing in Wales, became the leading advocate for celebrating Betsi Cadwaladr\u2019s considerable achievements.\nSince 2005 there have been many developments, including the RCN Wales biennial Betsi Cadwaladr Lecture which has been presented by:\n\n2006 Sue Essex AM, who delivered the inaugural lecture\n2008  Julian Tudor Hart who in the 1970s wrote the inverse care law.\n2010 Julie Morgan MP, now Assembly Member\n2012 Christine Mary Evans, retired consultant urologist\n2014 Roy Lilley, NHS writer, broadcaster and commentator\n2017 Dame Rosemary Butler, former Assembly member and Presiding Officer, Welsh Assembly\nIn 2014 a Western Mail survey of the 50 greatest Welsh people of all time rated Betsi Cadwaladr at 38; this was rated higher than notable individuals such as the singer Tom Jones , the actor Anthony Hopkins , the songwriter Ivor Novello and sportsmen such as Ryan Giggs and John Charles .\nTo commemorate the centenary of International Women\u0027s Day in 2011 the National Federation of Women\u0027s Institutes - Wales organised 3 events, one each in Cardiff, Llangollen and Carmarthen. Contributors at each event were asked to select a woman who had been inspirational and to speak about her. Professor Donna Mead, who spoke in Carmarthen selected Betsi Cadwaladr. Following the event, The NFWI-Wales produced a booklet containing the presentations from across Wales. It transpired that Betsi Cadwaladr had also been selected by Gretta Cartwright who spoke in Llangollen, so Betsi had two entries in that publication.\r\n\r\n== Works ==\nAutobiography of Elizabeth Davis, 1857.
