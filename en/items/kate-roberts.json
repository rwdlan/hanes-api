  "wikiArticle": "Kate Roberts was one of the foremost Welsh-language authors of the 20th century. Styled Brenhines ein ll\u00EAn , she is known mainly for her short stories, but also wrote novels. Roberts was a prominent Welsh nationalist. In 1963, she was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature by Welsh scholar Idris Foster.\r\n\r\n== Life ==\nKate Roberts was born in the village of Rhosgadfan, on the slopes of Moel Tryfan, Caernarfonshire . She was the oldest child of Owen Roberts, a quarryman in the local slate industry, and Catrin Roberts. She had two half-sisters and two half-brothers from earlier marriages of her parents, and three younger brothers . She was born in the family cottage Bryn Gwyrfai and later moved to Cae\u0027r Gors. Later the life in the cottage and village made an all-important backdrop to her early literary work. Her autobiographical volume Y L\u00F4n Wen is a memorable portrayal of the district in that period.\n\nShe attended the council school at Rhosgadfan from 1895 to 1904, and Caernarfonshire School from 1904 to 1910. She went on to graduate in Welsh at the University College of North Wales, Bangor, which she attended from 1910 to 1913 under John Morris-Jones and Ifor Williams, and trained as a teacher. She taught in various schools in Wales .\nRoberts met Morris T. Williams at Plaid Cymru meetings, and married him in 1928. Williams was a printer, and eventually they bought the printing and publishing house Gwasg Gee , Denbigh, and moved to live in the town in 1935. The press published books, pamphlets and the Welsh-language weekly Y Faner , for which Roberts wrote regularly. After her husband\u0027s death in 1946, she ran the press for another 10 years.\nIn 1965 Roberts bought Cae\u0027r Gors and presented it to the nation, but at the time there was not enough money to restore it. It was not restored until 2005, after a long campaign to raise the money. It is now in the care of Cadw as a museum presentation of Roberts.\nShe remained in Denbigh after her retirement and died in 1985. \n\n\n=== Sexuality ===\nAlan Llwyd\u0027s 2011 biography of Roberts used diaries and letters to shed fresh light on her private life and her relationship with Morris. Llwyd suggests that Roberts may have had lesbian tendencies. For example, Roberts sent a letter to her husband describing the joy she felt when kissing another woman in Pontardawe, saying that nothing had ever made her more happy.\r\n\r\n== Work ==\nHer first volume of short stories, O gors y bryniau , appeared in 1925. Perhaps her most successful book of short stories is Te yn y grug , a series about children. Of the novels that Roberts wrote, the most famous may have been Traed mewn cyffion , which reflected the hard life of a slate-quarrying family. The book was awarded a prize at the National Eisteddfod of Wales in Neath in 1934. She won the prize jointly with Grace Wynne Griffith and her novel Creigiau Milgwyn. However it was alleged that Creigiau Milgwyn was unworthy of the prize according to the historian Thomas Richards.\nIn 1960 Roberts published Y L\u00F4n Wen, a volume of autobiography.\nMost of her novels and short stories are set in the Arfon region where she lived in North Wales. She herself said that she derived the material for her work \u0022from the society in which I was brought up, a poor society in an age of poverty... [where] it was always a struggle against poverty. But notice that the characters haven\u0027t reached the bottom of that poverty, they are struggling against it, afraid of it.\u0022\nThus her work deals with the uneventful lives of humble people and how they deal with difficulties and disillusionments. It is remarkable for the richness of her language and for her perception. The role of women in society and progressive ideas about life and love are major themes.\nMany of her works have been translated into other languages including in Dutch, French, and German.\nRoberts struck up a literary relationship with Saunders Lewis, which they maintained through letters over a period of forty years. These letters give a picture of life in Wales during the period and record the comments of two literary giants on events at home and abroad.\nIn 1981, Kate Roberts: Bro a Bywyd, a book of 101 biographical photos, edited with an introduction by Derek Llwyd Morgan, was published by Cyngor Celfyddydau Cymru, Cardiff. The plates include extensive photographs from Kate Roberts\u0027 life, her family, and the places she lived. Also letters, documents, certificates, monuments, and handbills; the text and descriptive captions entirely in Welsh.\r\n\r\n== Selected works ==\n\n\n=== In Welsh ===\nDavies, Betty Eynon, and Kate Roberts.
