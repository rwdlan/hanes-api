Matters devolved to the Senedd include health, education, economic development, transport, the environment, agriculture, local government and some taxes.\r\n\r\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Road to devolution ===\n\nPolitical movements supporting Welsh self-rule began in the late nineteenth century alongside a rise in Welsh nationalism. The Sunday Closing Act 1881 was the first legislation to acknowledge that Wales had a separate politico-legal character from England. The late 19th century saw the formation of a number of national institutions; a national and annual cultural event, the National Eisteddfod of Wales in 1861, the Football Association of Wales in 1876, the Welsh Rugby Union in 1881 and the University of Wales in 1893.\nIn 1896, Education in Wales began to become distinct with the formation of the Central Welsh Board which inspected grammar schools in Wales and The Welsh Intermediate Education Act 1889 was brought about to \u0022make further provision for the intermediate and technical education of the inhabitants of Wales and the county of Monmouth.\u0022, making the board responsible for inspection of secondary schools. In 1907, the Welsh department of the Board of Education was formed and in the same year, a Welsh Inspectorate was established for inspection of elementary schools in Wales.\nThe early 20th century also saw the continued formation of a number of Welsh national institutions; the National Library of Wales in 1911, the Welsh Guards in 1915 and the Welsh Board of Health in 1919. The Church in Wales came into existence in 1920 following the disestablishment of the Church of England via the Welsh Church Act 1914.\nAn appointed Council for Wales and Monmouthshire was established in 1949 to \u0022ensure the government is adequately informed of the impact of government activities on the general life of the people of Wales\u0022. The council had 27 members nominated by local authorities in Wales, the University of Wales, National Eisteddfod Council and the Welsh Tourist Board. A post of Minister of Welsh Affairs was created in 1951 and the post of Secretary of State for Wales and the Welsh Office were established in 1964 leading to the abolition of the Council for Wales. The establishment of the Welsh Office effectively created the basis for the territorial governance of Wales. The Royal Commission on the Constitution was set up in 1969 by Harold Wilson\u0027s Labour Government to investigate the possibility of devolution for Scotland and Wales. Its recommendations formed the basis of the 1974 White paper Democracy and Devolution: proposals for Scotland and Wales, which proposed the creation of a Welsh Assembly. However, Welsh voters overwhelmingly rejected the proposals in a referendum held in 1979.\nFollowing the 1997 general election, the new Labour Government argued that an Assembly would be more democratically accountable than the Welsh Office. For eleven years prior to 1997 Wales had been represented in the Cabinet of the United Kingdom by a Secretary of State who did not represent a Welsh constituency at Westminster. A referendum was held in Wales on 18 September 1997 in which voters approved the creation of the National Assembly for Wales with a total of 559,419 votes, or 50.3% of the vote.\nThe following year the Government of Wales Act was passed by the United Kingdom parliament, establishing the Assembly. On 1 July 1999 the powers of the Secretary of State for Wales were transferred to the Assembly and the Welsh Office ceased to exist.\nIn July 2002, the Welsh Government established an independent commission, with Lord Richard as chair, to review the powers and electoral arrangements of the National Assembly to ensure that it is able to operate in the best interests of the people of Wales. The Richard Commission reported in March 2004. It recommended that the National Assembly should have powers to legislate in certain areas, whilst others would remain the preserve of Westminster. It also recommended changing the electoral system to the single transferable vote which would produce greater proportionality.\nIn response, the British government, in its Better Governance for Wales White Paper, published on 15 June 2005, proposed a more permissive law-making system for the Welsh Assembly based on the use of Parliamentary Orders in Council. In so doing, the Government rejected many of the cross party Richard Commission\u0027s recommendations. This has attracted criticism from opposition parties and others.\n\n\n=== Enhanced powers: The Government of Wales Act 2006 ===\n\nThe Government of Wales Act 2006 received Royal assent on 25 July 2006. It conferred on the Assembly legislative powers similar to other devolved legislatures through the ability to pass Assembly Measures concerning matters that are devolved. Requests for further legislative powers made through legislative competence requests were subject to the veto of the Secretary of State for Wales, House of Commons or House of Lords.\nThe Act reformed the assembly to a parliamentary-type structure, establishing the Welsh Government as an entity separate from, but accountable to the National Assembly. It enables the Assembly to legislate within its devolved fields.\nThe Act also reforms the Assembly\u0027s electoral system. It prevents individuals from standing as candidates in both constituency and regional seats. This aspect of the act was subject to a great deal of criticism, most notably from the Electoral Commission., although it was supported in the Richard Commission\nThe Act was heavily criticised. Plaid Cymru, the Official Opposition in the National Assembly from 1999 to 2007, attacked it for not delivering a fully-fledged parliament. Many commentators have also criticised the Labour Party\u0027s allegedly partisan attempt to alter the electoral system. By preventing regional Members from standing in constituency seats the party has been accused of changing the rules to protect constituency representatives. Labour had 29 members in the Assembly at the time, all of whom held constituency seats.\nThe changes to the Assembly\u0027s powers were commenced on 4 May 2007, after the election.\nFollowing a referendum on 3 March 2011, the Welsh Assembly gained direct law making powers, without the need to consult Westminster.\n\n\n=== Reserved powers model: The Wales Act 2017 ===\n\nThe Conservative-Liberal coalition government created the Commission on Devolution in Wales , composed of members nominated by the 4 parties represented in the Welsh Assembly and several leading legal and political experts, to \u0022create a lasting devolution settlement for Wales\u0022. Following the first set of recommendations by the Commission, the UK government announced in November 2013 that some borrowing powers are to be devolved to the Assembly along with control of landfill tax and stamp duty. Additionally the Wales Act 2014 provides for a referendum to be held on the Assembly\u0027s ability to set a degree of income tax, though there is a proposal for the requirement for a referendum to be removed.\nBoth the UK and Welsh governments supported the Silk Commission proposal to move to a \u0022reserved powers\u0022 model of devolution where the UK government would have specific \u0022reserved\u0022 powers and the Welsh Assembly would have control of all other matters. This replaced the previous model where certain powers were \u0022conferred\u0022 and all others were assumed to be powers of the UK national government. Since the passing of the Wales Act 2017, the power model in Wales has been in line with that of Scotland, being a reserved matter model.\nThe Wales Act 2017, based on the second set of recommendations of the Silk Commission, proposed devolving further areas of government, including some relating to water, marine affairs , energy , rail franchising and road travel.\n\n\n=== Name change ===\nIn July 2016, Assembly members unanimously agreed that the name of the Assembly should reflect its constitutional status as a national parliament. The Assembly Commission ran a public consultation on the proposal, which showed that 61% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that the Assembly should change its name. In 2018, the commission announced its intention to introduce legislation to change the name of the Assembly. Later that year, the Llywydd \u2013 the Assembly\u0027s presiding officer \u2013 wrote to all Assembly Members explaining that the name change proposed in the Bill would be the monolingual name Senedd. In 2019, the Senedd and Elections Bill, favouring the name Senedd, was introduced on behalf of the Assembly Commission. Following support of a subsequent amendment to the Bill which favoured a bilingual name for the institution, the Bill was passed by the Assembly on 27 November 2019 and was given Royal Assent on 15 January 2020. The Act changed the name of the Assembly to Senedd Cymru or the Welsh Parliament. Its guidance states that the institution will be commonly known as the Senedd in both languages. The name change came into effect on 6 May 2020. Members of the renamed body are known as Members of the Senedd , or Aelodau o\u0027r Senedd in Welsh.\n\n\n=== Constraints on powers: UK Internal Market Act 2020 ===\nAs part of the process of leaving the European Union, the Conservative Party in power in Westminster passed the United Kingdom Internal Market Act 2020. This legislation aims to prevent internal trade barriers within the UK, and to restrict the exercise of legislative powers of the devolved administrations in economic areas. It has several effects on the constitutional arrangements regarding devolved legislative powers. Principal amongst these is the effect that the market access principles will have on the practical ability of the devolved administrations to regulate economic activity. It also expressly reserves the regulation of distortive or harmful subsidies to the UK Government, and gives them spending powers in numerous policymaking areas.\nThese powers undermine the authority of the Senedd to determine infrastructure priorities within its jurisdiction. The principles undermine devolved competences in two ways. These relate to its status as a protected enactment, and to the disproportionate market size and power of the economy under English jurisdiction. Because the Senedd will be unable to disapply the market access principles, if they attempt to introduce new or stricter regulatory standards, they will only apply to goods produced within the devolved jurisdiction. This means that these standards will have little or no practical effect other than to disadvantage their own economy, severely restricting their ability to introduce regulatory divergence, or pursue different economic or social choices to those made in Westminster.\n\n\n=== Expansion ===\n\nOn 22 November 2021, Welsh Labour and Plaid Cymru agreed a co-operation deal that will see the implementation of 46 policies that the two parties share. One of these is the expansion of the Senedd from 60 Members to between 80 and 100 Members.\nAt its Conference on 12 March 2022, Welsh Labour unanimously approved increasing the size of the Senedd. \u0022The expansion of the Senedd is essential because the journey of devolution is not yet complete\u0022, former First Minister Alun Michael said. \u0022There is more to come. And the capacity needs to be there for those backbenchers to do the job of holding to account that you rightly said, cannot be done by to smaller number of representatives.\u0022 Two weeks later, Plaid members backed the expansion proposal as well.\nOn 10 May 2022, plans to increase the number of MSs from 60 to 96 were unveiled, as well as the scrapping of first past the post, which is currently used to elect 40 of the 60 Members of the Senedd . Drakeford said these changes were required as \u0022report after report\u0022 had demonstrated that the Senedd in its current form \u0022cannot do the job in the way that people in Wales have a right to expect it to be done\u0022. Welsh Lib Dem leader Jane Dodds criticised these plans, claiming that they would disproportionately impact smaller parties.\nOn 8 June 2022, the Senedd voted 40\u201314 in favour of expanding the number of MSs.\nIn 2023, the reform bill committee heard reforms included taking 32 new constituencies created that will be used in the 2024 general election and pairing them to create 16 Senedd constituencies \u2013 with each returning six members in multi-member districts. Opposition to the proposed closed list voting system was expressed by some Labour and Plaid Cymru representatives, while opposition to the overall expansion of the Senedd was expressed by some Labour representatives and the Conservatives.\r\n\r\n== Buildings ==\n\n\n=== Senedd building ===\n\nThe debating chamber in Cardiff Bay, the Senedd , was designed by the Richard Rogers Partnership, and built by Taylor Woodrow, with environmental, mechanical, electrical and plumbing design by BDSP Partnership. It uses traditional Welsh materials, such as slate and Welsh oak, in its construction, and the design is based around the concepts of openness and transparency. The timber ceiling and centre funnel, manufactured and installed by BCL Timber Projects is made from Canadian sourced Western Red Cedar.\n\nThe Senedd houses the debating chamber known as the Siambr and Committee Rooms. It was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II on Saint David\u0027s Day, 1 March 2006.\nThe Senedd is designed to be environmentally friendly: it uses an Earth Heat Exchange system for heating; rainwater is collected from the roof and used for flushing toilets and cleaning windows, and the roof features a wind cowl which funnels natural light and air into the debating chamber below.\n\n\n=== Telecasting ===\n\nThe building houses the debating chamber and committee rooms for the Senedd. When the Senedd building opened on 1 March 2006, there was regular screening of live proceedings from the Siambr on S4C2 and also on internet television. Coverage of the S4C2 screenings were on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays between 9:00 am 6:00 pm when the Senedd was sitting. In addition, limited screens were shown on the BBC Two Wales programme \u0022am.pm\u0022, including First Minister\u0027s Questions. These were decommissioned after S4C2 switched its scheduling to children programs and because of budget cuts. Internet television screenings are now shown on the Senedd\u0027s own website called Senedd.tv, which screens approximately 35 hours of content each week in English and Welsh. The service began 15 April 2008. Key events such as First Minister\u0027s Questions are shown live and recorded on BBC Parliament on television and on iPlayer. Also on BBC Parliament some proceedings are shown as highlights of the week on the programme The Week in Parliament.\nIn October 2023, GB News was banned from the Senedd\u0027s internal TV system, with a spokesperson for the presiding officer claiming the channel was \u0022deliberately offensive, demeaning to public debate and contrary to our parliament\u0027s values\u0022.\n\n\n=== T\u0177 Hywel and Pierhead Building ===\n\nBetween 1999 and 2006, a temporary debating chamber was initially based in T\u0177 Hywel, next to the site of the present building. The offices of Members are still in this building which is connected to the Senedd by a skyway. T\u0177 Hywel once again hosts plenary sessions of the Senedd between April 2025 and March 2026 whilst the debating chamber in the Senedd building undergoes refurbishment to increase its capacity in the lead up to the next Senedd election where the number of members returned is to rise to 96.\nThe Senedd Commission is also responsible for the Pierhead Building, which is the location of \u0022The Assembly at the Pierhead\u0022 exhibition, and is the Visitor and Education Centre for the Senedd as well as housing a small gift shop. The exhibition provides visitors with information on the history, functions and day-to-day work of the Senedd.\n\n\n=== North Wales Office ===\n\nThe Senedd North Wales Office is located at Government Buildings, Llandudno Junction. The office is open to the public to access information about the Senedd on weekdays between 10:00 and 12:00 and 14:00 and 16:00. Previously the office was located at Prince\u0027s Park, Colwyn Bay.\r\n\r\n== Officials ==\n\n\n=== Elected officials ===\n\nAfter each election, the Senedd elects one Member of the Senedd to serve as Llywydd of the Senedd, and another to serve as Deputy Presiding Officer . Elin Jones, Plaid Cymru MS, has been Llywydd since 2016, having taken over from Rosemary Butler. The Llywydd also acts as Chair of the Senedd Commission. Both the Llywydd and the Deputy Presiding Officer typically don\u0027t vote in simple-majority votes.\n\n\n=== Permanent officials ===\nThe permanent administrative and support staff of the Senedd are employed by the Senedd Commission. They are not civil servants, although they enjoy similar terms and conditions of service to members of the UK Civil Service. The most senior permanent official is the chief executive and clerk, and the position is currently held by Manon Antoniazzi.\r\n\r\n== Powers and status ==\n\nThe Senedd consists of 60 elected members. They use the title Member of the Senedd or Aelod o\u0027r Senedd . The executive arm of the Senedd, the Welsh Government, has been a Labour administration since its inception in 1999. Currently it is led by First Minister, Eluned Morgan, Baroness Morgan of Ely, since August 2024. The government between 2007 and 2011, had been a coalition between Labour, led by First Minister Carwyn Jones and Plaid Cymru, led by Deputy First Minister Ieuan Wyn Jones; and between 2016 and 2021, Labour had been in coalition with the Liberal Democrats and an independent member. Since 2021, the government has been a Labour minority government. The executive and civil servants are mainly based in Cardiff\u0027s Cathays Park while the MSs, the Senedd Commission and Ministerial support staff are based in Cardiff Bay, where a new \u00A367 million building, the Senedd, has been built.\nOne important feature of the National Assembly until 2007 was that there was no legal or constitutional separation of the legislative and executive functions, since it was a single corporate entity. Compared with other parliamentary systems, and arrangements for devolution in other countries of the UK, this was unusual. In practice, however, there was separation of functions, and the terms \u0022Assembly\u0022 and \u0022Assembly Parliamentary Service\u0022 came into use to distinguish between the two arms. The Government of Wales Act 2006 regularised the separation when it came into effect following the 2007 Assembly Election.\nInitially, the Assembly did not have primary legislative or fiscal powers, as these powers were reserved by Westminster. The Assembly did have powers to pass secondary legislation in devolved areas. Sometimes secondary legislation could be used to amend primary legislation, but the scope of this was very limited. For example, the first Government of Wales Act gave the Assembly power to amend primary legislation relating to the merger of certain public bodies. However, most secondary powers were conferred on the executive by primary legislation to give the executive more powers, and the Assembly had wider legislative powers than appearances might suggest. For example, the Assembly delayed local elections due to be held in 2003 for a year by use of secondary powers, so that they would not clash with Assembly elections. In 2001 the UK parliament used primary legislation to delay for one month local elections in England during the Foot-and-mouth disease epidemic.\nThe Assembly gained limited primary legislative powers following the 2007 election and the passage of the Government of Wales Act 2006. These laws are known as Assembly Measures and can be enacted in specific fields and matters within the legislative competency of the Assembly. New matters and fields can be devolved by Acts of the UK Parliament or by LCOs approved by Parliament.\nUntil 2015 the Assembly had no tax-varying powers, however it could influence the rate of Council Tax set by local authorities, which are part-funded by a grant from the Welsh government. It also has some discretion over charges for government services. Notable examples in which this discretion has been used to create significant differences from other areas in the UK are:\n\nCharges for NHS prescriptions in Wales \u2013 these have now been abolished.\nCharges for University Tuition \u2013 are different for Welsh resident students studying at Welsh Universities, compared with students from or studying elsewhere in the UK.\nCharging for Residential Care \u2013 In Wales there is a flat rate of contribution towards the cost of nursing care for those who require residential care.\nThis means in reality that there is a wider definition of \u0022nursing care\u0022 than in England and therefore less dependence on means testing in Wales than in England, so that more people are entitled to higher levels of state assistance. These variations in the levels of charges may be viewed as de facto tax varying powers.\nThis model of more limited legislative powers created in 1999 was partly because Wales has had the same legal system as England since 1536 , when it was merged with England. Ireland and Scotland were never merged with England, and so always retained some differences in their legal systems. The Scottish Parliament and the Northern Ireland Assembly both have deeper and wider powers.\nThe Assembly inherited the powers and budget of the Secretary of State for Wales and most of the functions of the Welsh Office. It has power to vary laws passed by Westminster using secondary legislation.\nFollowing a referendum on 4 March 2011, the Welsh Assembly gained direct law-making powers .\nOn 3 July 2012, the Welsh Assembly passed its first Act, the Local Government Byelaws Act.\nThe Wales Act 2014 and Wales Act 2017 devolved the following taxes to the Welsh Assembly:\n\nNon-Domestic Rates in Wales \u2013 from 1 April 2015\nLand Transaction Tax \u2013 from 1 April 2018\nLandfill Disposals Tax \u2013 from 1 April 2018\nWelsh Rates of Income Tax \u2013 from 1 April 2019\n\n\n=== Powers of the Senedd ===\n\nThe Senedd has the competence to pass bills for Acts of Senedd Cymru in all areas which are not explicitly reserved to Westminster; these \u0027reserved matters\u0027 are outlined in schedule 7A of the Government of Wales Act 2006.\nThis means the Senedd has powers over areas such as:\n\nAgriculture, fisheries, forestry and rural development\nCulture\nEconomic development\nEducation and training\nEnvironment\nHealth and health services\nHighways and transport\nLocal government\nTourism\nWelsh language\nReserved matters include subjects such as:\n\nForeign affairs\nPolice and justice\nCurrency\nMost benefits\nMost taxes\nDefence\r\n\r\n== Members, constituencies, and electoral system ==\n  \n\nUnder the Additional Member System, forty of the MSs are elected from single-member constituencies on a plurality voting system basis, the constituencies being equivalent to those used for the House of Commons and twenty MSs are elected from regional closed lists using an alternative party vote. There are five regions: Mid and West Wales, North Wales, South Wales Central, South Wales East and South Wales West , each of which returns four members. The additional members produce a degree of proportionality within each region. Whereas voters can choose any regional party list irrespective of their party vote in the constituency election, list MSs are not elected independently of the constituency element; rather, elected constituency MSs are deemed to be pre-elected list representatives for the purposes of calculating remainders in the D\u0027Hondt method. Overall proportionality is limited by the low proportion of list members , the regionalisation of the list element, and the lack of overhang seat compensation and leveling seats. Consequently, the Senedd as a whole has a greater degree of proportionality than the plurality voting system used for British parliamentary elections, but still deviates somewhat from proportionality.\nWith the recently passed Senedd Cymru Act 2024  the voting system will be changed to a closed list proportional representation system using the D\u2019Hondt method with 6 seat constituencies. This will be enacted in 2026 and may be used for the next election if it is scheduled for after then.\nIn April 2020 the Senedd became the first legislature in the UK to meet over the internet. Due to the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, it held First Minister\u0027s Questions using Zoom videotelephony software and the session was subsequently broadcast by Senedd.tv.\r\n\r\n== Elections ==\n\nThere have been six elections to the Senedd, in 1999, 2003, 2007, 2011, 2016 and 2021. The 2016 election was delayed from 2015 as the UK general election was held in 2015, and following the passing of the Wales Act 2014, elections occur every five years from the 2016 election.\nThe next Senedd election is due to be held on Thursday 7 May 2026.\n\n\n=== Summary ===\r\n\r\n== Current composition ==\n\n\n=== Government formation ===\nWelsh Labour won 30 seats out of 60 in the 2021 Senedd elections. On 9 May 2021 the First Minister, Mark Drakeford MS said \u0022We have demonstrated over a number of governments that you can govern successfully on 30 seats, but I\u0027m open to working with any party where there is common ground between us.\u0022\nOn 22 November 2021, a deal between Welsh Labour and Plaid Cymru was announced. The agreement was not one which saw Plaid Cymru entering a coalition in government with Labour, with Plaid Cymru MSs remaining in opposition. However, Plaid Cymru were able to appoint special advisors to the Welsh Government in a deal which was designed to last for three years. On 17 May 2024, Plaid Cymru announced it would uniliaterally exit the agreement due to concerns with the Labour government\u0027s ethics.",
