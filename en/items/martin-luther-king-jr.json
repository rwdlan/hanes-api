The Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., was dedicated in 2011.\r\n\r\n== Early life and education ==\n\n\n=== Birth ===\nMichael King Jr. was born on January 15, 1929, in Atlanta, the second of three children born to Michael King Sr. and Alberta King .  Alberta\u0027s father, Adam Daniel Williams, was a minister in rural Georgia, moved to Atlanta in 1893, and became pastor of the Ebenezer Baptist Church in the following year. Williams married Jennie Celeste Parks. Michael Sr. was born to sharecroppers James Albert and Delia King of Stockbridge, Georgia; he was likely of Mende descent. He enrolled in Morehouse College to study for entry to the ministry. Michael Sr. and Alberta began dating in 1920, and married on November 25, 1926. Until Jennie\u0027s death in 1941, their home was on the second floor of Alberta\u0027s parents\u0027 home, where King was born. Michael Jr. had an older sister, Christine King Farris, and a younger brother, Alfred Daniel King.\nShortly after marrying Alberta, Michael King Sr. became assistant pastor of the Ebenezer church. Senior pastor Williams died in the spring of 1931 and that fall Michael Sr. took the role. With support from his wife, he raised attendance from six hundred to several thousand. In 1934, the church sent King Sr. on a multinational trip; one of the stops being Berlin for the Fifth Congress of the Baptist World Alliance . He also visited sites in Germany that are associated with the Reformation leader Martin Luther. In reaction to the rise of Nazism, the Congress of the BWA adopted, in August 1934, a resolution saying, \u0022This Congress deplores and condemns as a violation of the law of God the Heavenly Father, all racial animosity, and every form of oppression or unfair discrimination toward the Jews, toward colored people, or toward subject races in any part of the world.\u0022 After returning home in August 1934, Michael Sr. changed his name to Martin Luther King Sr. and his five-year-old son\u0027s name to Martin Luther King Jr.\n\n\n=== Early childhood ===\n\nAt his childhood home, Martin King Jr. and his two siblings read aloud the Bible as instructed by their father. After dinners, Martin Jr.\u0027s grandmother Jennie, whom he affectionately referred to as \u0022Mama\u0022, told lively stories from the Bible. Martin Jr.\u0027s father regularly used whippings to discipline his children, sometimes having them whip each other. Martin Sr. later remarked, \u0022[Martin Jr.] was the most peculiar child whenever you whipped him. He\u0027d stand there, and the tears would run down, and he\u0027d never cry.\u0022 Once, when Martin Jr. witnessed his brother A.D. emotionally upset his sister Christine, he took a telephone and knocked A.D. unconscious with it. When Martin Jr. and his brother were playing at their home, A.D. slid from a banister and hit Jennie, causing her to fall unresponsive. Martin Jr., believing her dead, blamed himself and attempted suicide by jumping from a second-story window, but rose from the ground after hearing that she was alive.\nMartin King Jr. became friends with a white boy whose father owned a business across the street from his home. In September 1935, when the boys were about six years old, they started school. King had to attend a school for black children, Yonge Street Elementary School, while his playmate went to a separate school for white children only. Soon afterwards, the parents of the white boy stopped allowing King to play with their son, stating to him, \u0022we are white, and you are colored\u0022. When King relayed this to his parents, they talked with him about the history of slavery and racism in America, which King would later say made him \u0022determined to hate every white person\u0022. His parents instructed him that it was his Christian duty to love everyone.\nMartin King Jr. witnessed his father stand up against segregation and discrimination. Once, when stopped by a police officer who referred to Martin Sr. as \u0022boy\u0022, Martin Sr. responded sharply that Martin Jr. was a boy but he was a man. When Martin Jr\u0027s father took him into a shoe store in downtown Atlanta, the clerk told them they needed to sit in the back. Martin Sr. refused, asserting \u0022We\u0027ll either buy shoes sitting here or we won\u0027t buy any shoes at all\u0022, before leaving the store with Martin Jr. He told Martin Jr. afterward, \u0022I don\u0027t care how long I have to live with this system, I will never accept it.\u0022 In 1936, Martin Sr. led hundreds of African Americans in a civil rights march to the city hall in Atlanta to protest voting rights discrimination. Martin Jr. later remarked that Martin Sr. was \u0022a real father\u0022 to him.\nMartin King Jr. memorized hymns and Bible verses by the time he was five years old. Beginning at six years old, he attended church events with his mother and sang hymns while she played piano. His favorite hymn was \u0022I Want to Be More and More Like Jesus\u0022. King later became a member of the junior choir in his church. He enjoyed opera, and played the piano. King garnered a large vocabulary from reading dictionaries. He got into physical altercations with boys in his neighborhood, but oftentimes used his knowledge of words to stop or avoid fights. King showed a lack of interest in grammar and spelling, a trait that persisted throughout his life. In 1939, King sang as a member of his church choir dressed as a slave for the all-white audience at the Atlanta premiere of the film Gone with the Wind. In September 1940, at the age of 11, King was enrolled at the Atlanta University Laboratory School for the seventh grade. While there, King took violin and piano lessons and showed keen interest in history and English classes.\nOn May 18, 1941, when King had sneaked away from studying at home to watch a parade, he was informed that something had happened to his maternal grandmother. After returning home, he learned she had a heart attack and died while being transported to a hospital. He took her death very hard and believed that his deception in going to see the parade may have been responsible for God taking her. King again jumped out of a second-story window at his home but again survived. His father instructed him that Martin Jr. should not blame himself and that she had been called home to God as part of God\u0027s plan. Martin Jr. struggled with this. Shortly thereafter, Martin Sr. decided to move the family to a two-story brick home on a hill overlooking downtown Atlanta.\n\n\n=== Adolescence ===\n\nAs an adolescent, he initially felt resentment against whites due to the \u0022racial humiliation\u0022 that he, his family, and his neighbors often had to endure. In 1942, when King was 13, he became the youngest assistant manager of a newspaper delivery station for the Atlanta Journal. In the same year, King skipped the ninth grade and enrolled in Booker T. Washington High School, where he maintained a B-plus average. The high school was the only one in the city for African-American students.\nMartin Jr. was brought up in a Baptist home; as he entered adolescence he began to question the literalist teachings preached at his father\u0027s church. At the age of 13, he denied the bodily resurrection of Jesus during Sunday school. Martin Jr. said that he found himself unable to identify with the emotional displays from congregants who were frequent at his church; he doubted if he would ever attain personal satisfaction from religion. He later said of this point in his life, \u0022doubts began to spring forth unrelentingly.\u0022\nIn high school, Martin King Jr. became known for his public-speaking ability, with a voice that had grown into an orotund baritone. He joined the school\u0027s debate team. King continued to be most drawn to history and English, and chose English and sociology as his main subjects. King maintained an abundant vocabulary. However, he relied on his sister Christine to help him with spelling, while King assisted her with math. King also developed an interest in fashion, commonly wearing polished patent leather shoes and tweed suits, which gained him the nickname \u0022Tweed\u0022 or \u0022Tweedie\u0022 among his friends. He liked flirting with girls and dancing. His brother A.D. later remarked, \u0022He kept flitting from chick to chick, and I decided I couldn\u0027t keep up with him. Especially since he was crazy about dances, and just about the best jitterbug in town.\u0022\nOn April 13, 1944, in his junior year, King gave his first public speech during an oratorical contest. In his speech he stated, \u0022black America still wears chains. The finest negro is at the mercy of the meanest white man.\u0022 King was selected as the winner of the contest. On the ride home to Atlanta by bus, he and his teacher were ordered by the driver to stand so that white passengers could sit. The driver of the bus called King a \u0022black son-of-a-bitch\u0022. King initially refused but complied after his teacher told him that he would be breaking the law if he did not. As all the seats were occupied, he and his teacher were forced to stand the rest of the way to Atlanta. Later King wrote of the incident: \u0022That night will never leave my memory. It was the angriest I have ever been in my life.\u0022\n\n\n=== Morehouse College ===\nDuring King\u0027s junior year in high school, Morehouse College\u2014an all-male historically black college that King\u0027s father and maternal grandfather had attended\u2014began accepting high school juniors who passed the entrance examination. As World War II was underway, many black college students had been enlisted, so the university aimed to increase their enrollment by allowing juniors to apply. In 1944, aged 15, King passed the examination and was enrolled at the university that autumn.\nIn the summer before King started at Morehouse, he boarded a train with his friend\u2014Emmett \u0022Weasel\u0022 Proctor\u2014and a group of other Morehouse College students to work in Simsbury, Connecticut, at the tobacco farm of Cullman Brothers Tobacco. This was King\u0027s first trip into the integrated north. In a June 1944 letter to his father, King wrote about the differences that struck him: \u0022On our way here we saw some things I had never anticipated to see. After we passed Washington there was no discrimination at all. The white people here are very nice. We go to any place we want to and sit anywhere we want to.\u0022 The farm had partnered with Morehouse College to allot their wages towards the university\u0027s tuition, housing, and fees. On weekdays King and the other students worked in the fields, picking tobacco from 7:00 am to at least 5:00 pm, enduring temperatures above 100 \u00B0F, to earn roughly USD$4 per day. On Friday evenings, the students visited downtown Simsbury to get milkshakes and watch movies, and on Saturdays they would travel to Hartford, Connecticut, to see theatre performances, shop, and eat in restaurants. On Sundays, they attended church services in Hartford at a church filled with white congregants. King wrote to his parents about the lack of segregation, relaying how he was amazed they could go to \u0022one of the finest restaurants in Hartford\u0022 and that \u0022Negroes and whites go to the same church\u0022.\nHe played freshman football there. The summer before his last year at Morehouse, in 1947, the 18-year-old King chose to enter the ministry. He would later credit the college\u0027s president, Baptist minister Benjamin Mays, with being his \u0022spiritual mentor\u0022. King had concluded that the church offered the most assuring way to answer \u0022an inner urge to serve humanity\u0022, and he made peace with the Baptist Church, as he believed he would be a \u0022rational\u0022 minister with sermons that were \u0022a respectful force for ideas, even social protest.\u0022 King graduated from Morehouse with a Bachelor of Arts in sociology in 1948, aged nineteen.\r\n\r\n== Religious education ==\n\nKing enrolled in Crozer Theological Seminary in Upland, Pennsylvania, and took several courses at the University of Pennsylvania. At Crozer, King was elected president of the student body. At Penn, King took courses with William Fontaine, Penn\u0027s first African-American professor, and Elizabeth F. Flower, a professor of philosophy. King\u0027s father supported his decision to continue his education and made arrangements for King to work with J. Pius Barbour, a family friend and Crozer alumnus who pastored at Calvary Baptist Church in nearby Chester, Pennsylvania. King became known as one of the \u0022Sons of Calvary\u0022, an honor he shared with William Augustus Jones Jr. and Samuel D. Proctor, who both went on to become well-known preachers.\nKing reproved another student for keeping beer in his room once, saying they shared responsibility as African Americans to bear \u0022the burdens of the Negro race\u0022. For a time, he was interested in Walter Rauschenbusch\u0027s \u0022social gospel\u0022. In his third year at Crozer, King became romantically involved with Betty Moitz, the white daughter of an immigrant German woman who worked in the cafeteria. King planned to marry her, but friends, as well as King\u0027s father, advised against it, saying that an interracial marriage would provoke animosity from both blacks and whites, potentially damaging his chances of ever pastoring a church in the South. King tearfully told a friend that he could not endure his mother\u0027s pain over the marriage and broke the relationship off six months later. One friend was quoted as saying, \u0022He never recovered.\u0022 Other friends, including Harry Belafonte, said Betty had been \u0022the love of King\u0027s life.\u0022 King graduated with a Bachelor of Divinity in 1951. He applied to the University of Edinburgh for a doctorate in the School of Divinity but ultimately chose Boston instead.\nIn 1951, King began doctoral studies in systematic theology at Boston University, and worked as an assistant minister at Boston\u0027s historic Twelfth Baptist Church with William Hunter Hester. Hester was an old friend of King\u0027s father and was an important influence on King. In Boston, King befriended a small cadre of local ministers his age, and sometimes guest pastored at their churches, including Michael E. Haynes, associate pastor at Twelfth Baptist Church in Roxbury. The young men often held bull sessions in their apartments, discussing theology, sermon style, and social issues.\nAt the age of 25 in 1954, King was called as pastor of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama. King received his PhD on June 5, 1955, with a dissertation titled A Comparison of the Conceptions of God in the Thinking of Paul Tillich and Henry Nelson Wieman.\nAn academic inquiry in October 1991 concluded that portions of his doctoral dissertation were plagiarisms and he had acted improperly. However, \u0022[d]espite its finding, the committee said that \u0027no thought should be given to the revocation of Dr. King\u0027s doctoral degree,\u0027 an action that the panel said would serve no purpose.\u0022 The committee found that the dissertation still \u0022makes an intelligent contribution to scholarship.\u0022 A letter is now attached to the copy of King\u0027s dissertation in the university library, noting that numerous passages were included without the appropriate quotations and citations of sources. Significant debate exists on how to interpret King\u0027s plagiarism.\r\n\r\n== Marriage and family ==\n\nWhile studying at Boston University, King asked a friend from Atlanta named Mary Powell, a student at the New England Conservatory of Music, if she knew any nice Southern girls. Powell spoke to fellow student Coretta Scott; Scott was not interested in dating preachers but eventually agreed to allow King to telephone her based on Powell\u0027s description and vouching. On their first call, King told Scott, \u0022I am like Napoleon at Waterloo before your charms,\u0022 to which she replied: \u0022You haven\u0027t even met me.\u0022\nKing married Scott on June 18, 1953, on the lawn of her parents\u0027 house, in Heiberger, Alabama. They had four children: Yolanda King , Martin Luther King III , Dexter Scott King , and Bernice King . King limited Coretta\u0027s role in the civil rights movement, expecting her to be a housewife and mother.\r\n\r\n== Activism and organizational leadership ==\n\n\n=== Mary\u0027s Cafe Sit-In, 1950 ===\nOn Sunday, June 11, 1950, King, classmate at Crozer Seminary and housemate Walter McCall, and their dates Doris Wilson and Pearl Smith attended church services in Merchantville. Afterwards they stopped at tavern Mary\u0027s Cafe in Maple Shade for beers. The foursome were left waiting without anyone approaching them for service, not unexpectedly. A friend\u0027s father and King and McCall\u0027s landlord Jesthroe Hunt had warned them Black people were not welcome at Mary\u0027s. King replied to the effect of maybe they needed to go, so they could start to go anywhere they wanted. The seminarians had opted for Mary\u0027s Cafe with full knowledge of its reputation.  After waiting without service, McCall approached the bar.\nMcCall asked bartender and Mary\u0027s Cafe owner Ernest Nichols for packaged goods . Nichols refused, explaining he could not sell packaged goods on Sundays or any day after 10pm, by law. McCall then requested 4 glasses of beer to which Nichols answered \u0022no beer, Mr! Today is Sunday\u201D. Nichols would claim they sought him to violate New Jersey\u0027s blue law . McCall requested ginger ales as non-alcoholic beverages were not subject to the blue law. Nichols refused the group even ginger ales and reportedly stated \u0022the best thing would be for you to leave\u0022. King and company met refusal with refusal, and remained in their seats as was their right per New Jersey\u0027s 1945 anti-discrimination law, which guaranteed non-discrimination by race in public accommodations. Nichols stomped out and returned with a gun standing outside firing into the air reportedly shouting \u0022I\u0027d kill for less\u0022.  Fearing for their lives, the four activists ran from the tavern. The group went to the Maple Shade Police Department where officers refused to file their complaint. King and McCall contacted Ulysses Simpson Wiggins then President of the Camden County Branch NAACP, who helped them successfully file a police report. The New York Times confirms \u0022The complaint was against Ernest Nichols, a white tavern owner in Maple Shade, N.J., and said that he had refused to serve the black students and their dates in June 1950, and had threatened them by firing a gun in the air. The complaint was signed by the two students. One of the signatures, in a loopy, slanted cursive, reads \u0027M. L. King Jr.\u0027\u0022 \n\nNichols was charged with disorderly conduct and violation of the anti-discrimination law. He was found guilty and fined $50, however the racial discrimination count was dismissed. In a statement submitted \u0022in the spirit of assisting the Prosecutor\u0022 Nichol\u0027s attorney noted: Mr. Nichols claims that this act was not intended as a threat to his colored patrons. The colored patrons, on the other hand, while they admit that the gun was not pointed at them or any of them, seemed to think that it was a threat. Mr. Nichols on the other hand states that he has been held up before and he wanted to alert his watchdog who was somewhere outside on the tavern grounds.\nKing cited the incident saying it was \u201Ca formative step\u201D in his \u201Ccommitment to a more just society.\u201D The Mary\u0027s Cafe sit-in demonstrated the power of non-violent civil disobedience. Nichols\u0027 reaction in retrieving a weapon and discharging it to scare the group, or summon his guard dog, to young people\u0027s refusal to leave unserved, showed King the potency of such tactics. This sit-in is believed to be the first deployment of the non-violence and civil disobedience tactics which would distinguish King\u0027s activism and legacy.\nThe Mary\u0027s Cafe sit-in occurred six months prior to Mordecai Johnson\u0027s Lecture on Gandi at the First Unitarian Church of Philadelphia on November 19, 1950 where King would be formally exposed to these tactics. At that lecture and in discussions with Dr. Johnson at the Fellowship House, Dr. King would be inspired and galvanized by how Mahatma Gandhi integrated Henry David Thoreau\u0027s theory of Nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience tactics. Patrick Duff, a South Jersey resident, discovered the police report detailing the events at Mary\u0027s after searching the archive at The Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute.\n\n\n=== Montgomery bus boycott, 1955 ===\n\nThe Dexter Avenue Baptist Church was influential in the Montgomery African-American community. As the church\u0027s pastor, King became known for his oratorical preaching in Montgomery and surrounding region.\nIn March 1955, Claudette Colvin\u2014a black schoolgirl in Montgomery\u2014refused to give up her bus seat to a white man in violation of Jim Crow laws, local laws in the Southern US that enforced racial segregation. On December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her seat on a city bus. These incidents led to the Montgomery bus boycott, which was urged and planned by Edgar Nixon and led by King. The other ministers asked him to take a leadership role because his relative newness to community leadership made it easier for him to speak out. King was hesitant but decided to do so if no one else wanted it.\nThe boycott lasted for 385 days, and the situation became so tense that King\u0027s house was bombed. King was arrested for traveling 30 mph in a 25 mph zone and jailed, which drew the attention of national media, and increased King\u0027s public stature. The controversy ended when the US District Court issued a ruling in Browder v. Gayle that prohibited racial segregation on Montgomery public buses.\n\nKing\u0027s role in the bus boycott transformed him into a national figure and the best-known spokesman of the civil rights movement.\n\n\n=== Southern Christian Leadership Conference ===\nIn 1957, King, Ralph Abernathy, Fred Shuttlesworth, Joseph Lowery, and other activists founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference . The group was created to harness the moral authority and organizing power of black churches to conduct nonviolent protests in the service of civil rights reform. The group was inspired by the crusades of evangelist Billy Graham, who befriended King, as well as the national organizing of the group In Friendship, founded by King allies Stanley Levison and Ella Baker. King led the SCLC until his death. The SCLC\u0027s 1957 Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom was the first time King addressed a national audience.\nHarry Wachtel joined King\u0027s legal advisor Clarence B. Jones in defending four ministers of the SCLC in the libel case Abernathy et al. v. Sullivan; the case was litigated about the newspaper advertisement \u0022Heed Their Rising Voices\u0022. Wachtel founded a tax-exempt fund to cover the suit\u0027s expenses and assist the civil rights movement through more effective fundraising. King served as honorary president of this organization, named the \u0022Gandhi Society for Human Rights\u0022. In 1962, King and the Gandhi Society produced a document that called on President Kennedy to issue an executive order to deliver a blow for civil rights as a kind of Second Emancipation Proclamation. Kennedy did not execute the order. The FBI, under written directive from Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, began tapping King\u0027s telephone line in the fall of 1963. Kennedy was concerned that public allegations of communists in the SCLC would derail the administration\u0027s civil rights initiatives. He warned King to discontinue these associations and felt compelled to issue the directive that authorized the FBI to wiretap King and other SCLC leaders. FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover feared the civil rights movement and investigated the allegations of communist infiltration. When no evidence emerged to support this, the FBI used the incidental details caught on tape over the next five years, as part of its COINTELPRO program, in attempts to force King out of his leadership position.\nKing believed that organized, nonviolent protest against the system of southern segregation known as Jim Crow laws would lead to extensive media coverage of the struggle for black equality. Journalistic accounts and televised footage of the daily indignities suffered by southern blacks, and of segregationist violence and harassment, produced a wave of sympathetic public opinion that convinced most Americans that the civil rights movement was the most important political issue in the early 1960s.\nKing organized and led marches for blacks\u0027 right to vote, desegregation, labor rights, and other basic civil rights. Most of these rights were successfully enacted into law with the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the 1965 Voting Rights Act. The SCLC used tactics of nonviolent protest with success, by strategically choosing the methods and places in which protests were carried out. There were often dramatic stand-offs with segregationist authorities, who sometimes turned violent.\n\n\n=== Survived knife attack, 1958 ===\nOn September 20, 1958, King was signing copies of his book Stride Toward Freedom in Blumstein\u0027s department store in Harlem when Izola Curry\u2014a mentally ill black woman who thought King was conspiring against her with communists\u2014stabbed him in the chest with a letter opener, which nearly impinged on the aorta. King received first aid by police officers Al Howard and Philip Romano. King underwent surgery by Aubre de Lambert Maynard, Emil Naclerio and John W. V. Cordice; he remained hospitalized for weeks. Curry was later found mentally incompetent to stand trial.\n\n\n=== Atlanta sit-ins, prison sentence, and the 1960 elections ===\n\nIn December 1959, after being based in Montgomery for five years, King announced his return to Atlanta at the request of the SCLC. In Atlanta, King served until his death as co-pastor with his father at the Ebenezer Baptist Church. Georgia governor Ernest Vandiver expressed open hostility towards King\u0027s return. He claimed that \u0022wherever M. L. King Jr., has been there has followed in his wake a wave of crimes\u0022, and vowed to keep King under surveillance. On May 4, 1960, King drove writer Lillian Smith to Emory University when police stopped them. King was cited for \u0022driving without a license\u0022 because he had not yet been issued a Georgia license. King\u0027s Alabama license was still valid, and Georgia law did not mandate any time limit for issuing a local license. King paid a fine but was unaware his lawyer agreed to a plea deal that included probation.\nMeanwhile, the Atlanta Student Movement had been acting to desegregate businesses and public spaces, organizing the Atlanta sit-ins from March 1960 onwards. In August the movement asked King to participate in a mass October sit-in, timed to highlight how 1960\u0027s Presidential election campaigns had ignored civil rights. The coordinated day of action took place on October 19. King participated in a sit-in at the restaurant inside Rich\u0027s, Atlanta\u0027s largest department store, and was among the many arrested. The authorities released everyone over the next few days, except King. Invoking his probationary plea deal, Judge J. Oscar Mitchell sentenced King on October 25 to four months of hard labor. Before dawn the next day, King was transported to Georgia State Prison.\nThe arrest and harsh sentence drew nationwide attention. Many feared for King\u0027s safety, as he started a sentence with people convicted of violent crimes, many white and hostile to his activism. Presidential candidates were asked to weigh in, at a time when parties were courting the support of Southern Whites and their political leadership including Governor Vandiver. Nixon, with whom King had a closer relationship before, declined to make a statement despite a visit from Jackie Robinson requesting his intervention. Nixon\u0027s opponent John F. Kennedy called the governor, enlisted his brother Robert to exert more pressure on state authorities, and, at the request of Sargent Shriver, called King\u0027s wife to offer his help. The pressure from Kennedy and others proved effective, and King was released two days later. King\u0027s father decided to openly endorse Kennedy\u0027s candidacy for the November 8 election which he narrowly won.\nAfter the October 19 sit-ins and following unrest, a 30-day truce was declared in Atlanta for desegregation negotiations. However, negotiations failed and sit-ins and boycotts resumed for several months. On March 7, 1961, a group of Black elders including King notified student leaders that a deal had been reached: the city\u0027s lunch counters would desegregate in fall 1961, in conjunction with the court-mandated desegregation of schools. Many students were disappointed at the compromise. In a meeting on March 10 at Warren Memorial Methodist Church, the audience was hostile and frustrated. King gave an impassioned speech calling participants to resist the \u0022cancerous disease of disunity\u0022, helping to calm tensions.\n\n\n=== Albany Movement, 1961 ===\n\nThe Albany Movement was a desegregation coalition formed in Albany, Georgia, in November 1961. In December, King and the SCLC became involved. The movement mobilized thousands of citizens for a nonviolent attack on segregation in the city and attracted nationwide attention. When King first visited on December 15, 1961, he \u0022had planned to stay a day or so and return home after giving counsel.\u0022 The following day he was swept up in a mass arrest of peaceful demonstrators, and he declined bail until the city made concessions. According to King, \u0022that agreement was dishonored and violated by the city\u0022 after he left.\nKing returned in July 1962 and was given the option of 45 days in jail or a $178 fine ; he chose jail. Three days into his sentence, Police Chief Laurie Pritchett discreetly arranged for King\u0027s fine to be paid and ordered his release. \u0022We had witnessed persons being kicked off lunch counter stools ... ejected from churches ... and thrown into jail ... But for the first time, we witnessed being kicked out of jail.\u0022 It was later acknowledged by the King Center that Billy Graham was the one who bailed King out.\nAfter nearly a year of intense activism with few tangible results, the movement began to deteriorate. King requested a halt to all demonstrations and a \u0022Day of Penance\u0022 to promote nonviolence and maintain the moral high ground. Divisions within the black community and the canny, low-key response by local government defeated efforts. Though the Albany effort proved a key lesson in tactics for King and the civil rights movement, the national media was highly critical of King\u0027s role in the defeat, and the SCLC\u0027s lack of results contributed to a growing gulf between the organization and the more radical SNCC. After Albany, King sought to choose engagements for the SCLC in which he could control the circumstances, rather than entering into pre-existing situations.\n\n\n=== Birmingham campaign, 1963 ===\n\nIn April 1963, the SCLC began a campaign against racial segregation and economic injustice in Birmingham, Alabama. The campaign used nonviolent but intentionally confrontational tactics, developed in part by Wyatt Tee Walker. Black people in Birmingham, organizing with the SCLC, occupied public spaces with marches and sit-ins, openly violating laws that they considered unjust.\nKing\u0027s intent was to provoke mass arrests and \u0022create a situation so crisis-packed that it will inevitably open the door to negotiation.\u0022 The campaign\u0027s early volunteers did not succeed in shutting down the city, or in drawing media attention to the police\u0027s actions. Over the concerns of an uncertain King, SCLC strategist James Bevel changed the course of the campaign by recruiting children and young adults to join the demonstrations. Newsweek called this strategy a Children\u0027s Crusade.\nThe Birmingham Police Department, led by Eugene \u0022Bull\u0022 Connor, used high-pressure water jets and police dogs against protesters, including children. Footage of the police response was broadcast on national television, shocking many white Americans and consolidating black Americans behind the movement. Not all demonstrators were peaceful, despite the avowed intentions of the SCLC. In some cases, bystanders attacked the police, who responded with force. King and the SCLC were criticized for putting children in harm\u0027s way. But the campaign was a success: Connor lost his job, the \u0022Jim Crow\u0022 signs came down, and public places became more open to blacks. King\u0027s reputation improved immensely.\nKing was arrested and jailed early in the campaign\u2014his 13th arrest out of 29. From his cell, he composed the now-famous \u0022Letter from Birmingham Jail\u0022 that responds to calls to pursue legal channels for social change. The letter has been described as \u0022one of the most important historical documents penned by a modern political prisoner\u0022. King argues that the crisis of racism is too urgent, and the current system too entrenched: \u0022We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed.\u0022 He points out that the Boston Tea Party, a celebrated act of rebellion in the American colonies, was illegal civil disobedience, and that, conversely, \u0022everything Adolf Hitler did in Germany was \u0027legal\u0027.\u0022 Walter Reuther, president of the United Auto Workers, arranged for $160,000 to bail out King and his fellow protestors.\n\n\n=== March on Washington, 1963 ===\n\nKing, representing the SCLC, was among the leaders of the \u0022Big Six\u0022 civil rights organizations who were instrumental in the organization of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, which took place on August 28, 1963. The other leaders and organizations comprising the Big Six were Roy Wilkins from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People; Whitney Young, National Urban League; A. Philip Randolph, Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters; John Lewis, SNCC; and James L. Farmer Jr., Congress of Racial Equality.\nBayard Rustin\u0027s open homosexuality, support of socialism, and former ties to the Communist Party USA caused many white and African-American leaders to demand King distance himself, which King agreed to do. However, he did collaborate in the 1963 March on Washington, for which Rustin was the primary organizer. For King, this role was another which courted controversy, since he was a key figure who acceded to the wishes of President Kennedy in changing the focus of the march. Kennedy initially opposed the march outright, because he was concerned it would negatively impact the drive for passage of civil rights legislation. However, the organizers were firm the march would proceed. With the march going forward, the Kennedys decided it was important to ensure its success. President Kennedy was concerned the turnout would be less than 100,000 and enlisted the aid of additional church leaders and Walter Reuther, president of the United Automobile Workers, to help mobilize demonstrators.\n\nThe march originally was planned to dramatize the desperate condition of blacks in the southern US and place organizers\u0027 concerns and grievances squarely before the seat of power in the capital. Organizers intended to denounce the federal government for its failure to safeguard the civil rights and physical safety of civil rights workers and blacks. The group acquiesced to presidential pressure, and the event ultimately took on a less strident tone. As a result, some civil rights activists felt it presented an inaccurate, sanitized pageant of racial harmony; Malcolm X called it the \u0022Farce on Washington\u0022, and the Nation of Islam forbade its members from attending.\n\nThe march made specific demands: an end to racial segregation in public schools; meaningful civil rights legislation, including a law prohibiting racial discrimination in employment; protection of civil rights workers from police brutality; a $2 minimum wage for all workers ; and self-government for Washington, D.C., then governed by congressional committee. Despite tensions, the march was a resounding success. More than a quarter of a million people of diverse ethnicities attended, sprawling from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial onto the National Mall. At the time, it was the largest gathering of protesters in Washington, D.C.\u0027s history.\nKing delivered a 17-minute speech, later known as \u0022I Have a Dream\u0022. In the speech\u0027s most famous passage \u2013 in which he departed from his prepared text, possibly at the prompting of Mahalia Jackson, who shouted behind him, \u0022Tell them about the dream!\u0022 \u2013 King said:\n\n\u0022I Have a Dream\u0022 came to be regarded as one of the finest speeches in the history of oratory. The March, and especially King\u0027s speech, helped put civil rights at the top of the agenda of reformers and facilitated passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\n\n=== St. Augustine, Florida, 1964 ===\n\nIn March 1964, King and the SCLC joined forces with Robert Hayling\u0027s then-controversial movement in St. Augustine, Florida. Hayling\u0027s group had been affiliated with the NAACP but was forced out of the organization for advocating armed self-defense alongside nonviolent tactics. However, the pacifist SCLC accepted them. King and the SCLC worked to bring white Northern activists to St. Augustine, including a delegation of rabbis and the 72-year-old mother of the governor of Massachusetts, all of whom were arrested. During June, the movement marched nightly through the city, \u0022often facing counter demonstrations by the Klan, and provoking violence that garnered national media attention.\u0022 Hundreds of the marchers were arrested and jailed. During this movement, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed.\n\n\n=== Biddeford, Maine, 1964 ===\nOn May 7, 1964, King spoke at Saint Francis College\u0027s \u0022The Negro and the Quest for Identity\u0022, in Biddeford, Maine. This was a symposium that brought together many civil rights leaders. King spoke about how \u0022We must get rid of the idea of superior and inferior races,\u0022 through nonviolent tactics.\n\n\n=== New York City, 1964 ===\n\nOn February 6, 1964, King delivered the inaugural speech of a lecture series initiated at the New School called \u0022The American Race Crisis\u0022. In his remarks, King referred to a conversation he had recently had with Jawaharlal Nehru in which he compared the sad condition of many African Americans to that of India\u0027s untouchables. In his March 18, 1964, interview with Robert Penn Warren, King compared his activism to his father\u0027s, citing his training in non-violence as a key difference. He also discusses the next phase of the civil rights movement and integration.\n\n\n=== Scripto strike in Atlanta, 1964 ===\n\nStarting in November 1964, King supported a labor strike by several hundred workers at the Scripto factory in Atlanta, just a few blocks from Ebenezer Baptist. Many of the strikers were congregants of his church, and the strike was supported by other civil rights leaders. King helped elevate the labor dispute from a local to nationally known event and led the SCLC to organize a nationwide boycott of Scripto products. However, as the strike stretched into December, King, who was wanting to focus more on a civil rights campaign in Selma, Alabama, began to negotiate in secret with Scripto\u0027s president Carl Singer and eventually brokered a deal where the SCLC would call off their boycott in exchange for the company giving the striking employees their Christmas bonuses. King\u0027s involvement in the strike ended on December 24 and a contract between the company and union was signed on January 9.\n\n\n=== Selma voting rights movement and \u0022Bloody Sunday\u0022, 1965 ===\n\nIn December 1964, King and the SCLC joined forces with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee in Selma, Alabama, where the SNCC had been working on voter registration for several months. A local judge issued an injunction that barred any gathering of three or more people affiliated with the SNCC, SCLC, DCVL, or any of 41 named civil rights leaders. This injunction temporarily halted civil rights activity until King defied it by speaking at Brown Chapel on January 2, 1965. During the 1965 march to Montgomery, Alabama, violence by state police and others against the peaceful marchers resulted in much publicity, which made racism in Alabama visible nationwide.\nActing on James Bevel\u0027s call for a march from Selma to Montgomery, Bevel and other SCLC members, in partial collaboration with SNCC, attempted to organize a march to the state\u0027s capital. The first attempt to march on March 7, 1965, at which King was not present, was aborted because of mob and police violence against the demonstrators. This day has become known as Bloody Sunday and was a turning point in the effort to gain public support for the civil rights movement. It was the clearest demonstration up to that time of the dramatic potential of King and Bevel\u0027s nonviolence strategy.\nOn March 5, King met with officials in the Johnson Administration to request an injunction against any prosecution of the demonstrators. He did not attend the march due to church duties, but later wrote, \u0022If I had any idea that the state troopers would use the kind of brutality they did, I would have felt compelled to give up my church duties altogether to lead the line.\u0022 Footage of police brutality against the protesters was broadcast extensively and aroused public outrage.\nKing next attempted to organize a march for March 9. The SCLC petitioned for an injunction in federal court against Alabama; this was denied and the judge issued an order blocking the march until after a hearing. Nonetheless, King led marchers on March 9 to the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, then held a prayer session before turning the marchers around and asking them to disperse so as not to violate the court order. The unexpected ending of this second march aroused the surprise and anger of many within the local movement. The march finally went ahead fully on March 25, 1965. At the conclusion of the march on the steps of the state capitol, King delivered a speech that became known as \u0022How Long, Not Long\u0022. King stated that equal rights for African Americans could not be far away, \u0022because the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice\u0022 and \u0022you shall reap what you sow\u0022.\n\n\n=== Chicago open housing movement, 1966 ===\n\nIn 1966, after several successes in the south, King, Bevel, and others in the civil rights organizations took the movement to the North. King and Ralph Abernathy, both from the middle class, moved into a building at 1550 S. Hamlin Avenue, in the slums of North Lawndale on Chicago\u0027s West Side, as an educational experience and to demonstrate their support and empathy for the poor.\nThe SCLC formed a coalition with Coordinating Council of Community Organizations , an organization founded by Albert Raby, and the combined organizations\u0027 efforts were fostered under the aegis of the Chicago Freedom Movement.\nDuring that spring, several white couple/black couple tests of real estate offices uncovered racial steering, discriminatory processing of housing requests by couples who were exact matches in income and background. Larger marches were planned and executed: in Bogan, Belmont Cragin, Jefferson Park, Evergreen Park, Gage Park, Marquette Park, and others.\n\nKing later stated and Abernathy wrote that the movement received a worse reception in Chicago than in the South. Marches, especially the one through Marquette Park on August 5, 1966, were met by thrown bottles and screaming throngs. Rioting seemed very possible. King\u0027s beliefs militated against his staging a violent event, and he negotiated an agreement with Mayor Richard J. Daley to cancel a march to avoid the violence he feared would result. King was hit by a brick during one march, but continued to lead marches in the face of personal danger.\nWhen King and his allies returned to the South, they left Jesse Jackson, a seminary student who had previously joined the movement in the South, in charge of their organization. Jackson continued their struggle for civil rights by organizing the Operation Breadbasket movement that targeted chain stores that did not deal fairly with blacks. A 1967 CIA document declassified in 2017 downplayed King\u0027s role in the \u0022black militant situation\u0022 in Chicago, with a source stating that King \u0022sought at least constructive, positive projects.\u0022\n\n\n=== Opposition to the Vietnam War ===\n\nKing was long opposed to American involvement in the Vietnam War, but at first avoided the topic in speeches to avoid interference with civil rights goals that criticism of President Johnson\u0027s policies might have created. At the urging of SCLC\u0027s former Director of Direct Action and now the head of the Spring Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam, James Bevel, and inspired by the outspokenness of Muhammad Ali, King eventually agreed to publicly oppose the war, as opposition was growing among the public.\nDuring an April 1967 appearance at the New York City Riverside Church, King delivered a speech titled \u0022Beyond Vietnam: A Time to Break Silence\u0022. He spoke against America\u0027s role in the war, arguing the US was in Vietnam \u0022to occupy it as an American colony\u0022 and calling the US government \u0022the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today\u0022. He connected the war with economic injustice, arguing that the country needed serious moral change:\n\nA true revolution of values will soon look uneasily on the glaring contrast of poverty and wealth. With righteous indignation, it will look across the seas and see individual capitalists of the West investing huge sums of money in Asia, Africa and South America, only to take the profits out with no concern for the social betterment of the countries, and say: \u0022This is not just.\u0022 \nKing opposed the war because it took resources away from social welfare at home: \u0022A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death.\u0022 He stated that North Vietnam \u0022did not begin to send in any large number of supplies or men until American forces had arrived in the tens of thousands\u0022, and accused the U.S. of having killed a million Vietnamese, \u0022mostly children\u0022. King also criticized American opposition to North Vietnam\u0027s land reforms.\nKing\u0027s opposition cost him significant support among white allies including Johnson, Billy Graham, union leaders, and powerful publishers. \u0022The press is being stacked against me\u0022, King said, complaining of what he described as a double standard that applauded his nonviolence at home, but deplored it when applied \u0022toward little brown Vietnamese children\u0022. Life magazine called the speech \u0022demagogic slander that sounded like a script for Radio Hanoi\u0022, and The Washington Post declared that King had \u0022diminished his usefulness to his cause, his country, his people.\u0022\n\nThe \u0022Beyond Vietnam\u0022 speech reflected King\u0027s evolving political advocacy in his later years, which paralleled the teachings of the progressive Highlander Research and Education Center, with which he was affiliated. King began to speak of the need for fundamental changes in the American political and economic situation, and more frequently expressed his opposition to the war and his desire to see a redistribution of resources to correct injustice. He guarded his language in public to avoid being linked to communism, but in private sometimes spoke of his support for democratic socialism.\nKing stated in \u0022Beyond Vietnam\u0022 that \u0022true compassion is more than flinging a coin to a beggar ... it comes to see that an edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring.\u0022 King quoted a US official who said that from Vietnam to Latin America, the country was \u0022on the wrong side of a world revolution.\u0022 King condemned America\u0027s \u0022alliance with the landed gentry of Latin America\u0022, and said the US should support \u0022the shirtless and barefoot people\u0022 in the Third World rather than suppressing their attempts at revolution.\nKing\u0027s stance on Vietnam encouraged Allard K. Lowenstein, William Sloane Coffin and Norman Thomas, with the support of anti-war Democrats, to attempt to persuade King to run against President Johnson in the 1968 presidential election. King contemplated but decided against this as he felt uneasy with politics and considered himself better suited to activism.\nOn April 15, 1967, King spoke at an anti-war march from Manhattan\u0027s Central Park to the UN. The march was organized by the Spring Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam under chairman James Bevel. At the UN King brought up issues of civil rights and the draft:\n\nI have not urged a mechanical fusion of the civil rights and peace movements. There are people who have come to see the moral imperative of equality, but who cannot yet see the moral imperative of world brotherhood. I would like to see the fervor of the civil-rights movement imbued into the peace movement to instill it with greater strength. And I believe everyone has a duty to be in both the civil-rights and peace movements. But for those who presently choose but one, I would hope they will finally come to see the moral roots common to both.\nSeeing an opportunity to unite civil rights and anti-war activists, Bevel convinced King to become even more active in the anti-war effort. Despite his growing public opposition to the war, King was not fond of the hippie culture developed from the anti-war movement. In his 1967 Massey Lecture, King stated:\n\nThe importance of the hippies is not in their unconventional behavior, but in the fact that hundreds of thousands of young people, in turning to a flight from reality, are expressing a profoundly discrediting view on the society they emerge from.\nOn January 13, 1968, King called for a large march on Washington against \u0022one of history\u0027s most cruel and senseless wars\u0022:\n\nWe need to make clear in this political year, to congressmen on both sides of the aisle and to the president of the United States, that we will no longer tolerate, we will no longer vote for men who continue to see the killings of Vietnamese and Americans as the best way of advancing the goals of freedom and self-determination in Southeast Asia.\n\n\n==== Correspondence with Th\u00EDch Nh\u1EA5t H\u1EA1nh ====\nTh\u00EDch Nh\u1EA5t H\u1EA1nh was an influential Vietnamese Buddhist who wrote a letter to King in 1965 entitled: \u0022In Search of the Enemy of Man\u0022. It was during his 1966 stay in the US that Nh\u1EA5t H\u1EA1nh met with King and urged him to publicly denounce the war. In 1967, King gave a speech in New York City, his first to publicly question U.S. involvement in Vietnam. Later that year, King nominated Nh\u1EA5t H\u1EA1nh for the Nobel Peace Prize. In his nomination, King said, \u0022I do not personally know of anyone more worthy of [this prize] than this gentle monk from Vietnam. His ideas for peace, if applied, would build a monument to ecumenism, to world brotherhood, to humanity\u0022.\n\n\n=== Poor People\u0027s Campaign, 1968 ===\n\nIn 1968, King and the SCLC organized the \u0022Poor People\u0027s Campaign\u0022 to address issues of economic justice. King traveled the country to assemble \u0022a multiracial army of the poor\u0022 that would march on Washington to engage in nonviolent civil disobedience at the Capitol until Congress created an \u0022economic bill of rights\u0022.\nThe campaign was preceded by King\u0027s final book, Where Do We Go from Here: Chaos or Community? which laid out his view of how to address social issues and poverty. King quoted from Henry George\u0027s book Progress and Poverty, particularly in support of a guaranteed basic income. The campaign culminated in a march on Washington, D.C., demanding economic aid to the poorest communities of the U.S.\nKing and the SCLC called on the government to invest in rebuilding America\u0027s cities. He felt that Congress had shown \u0022hostility to the poor\u0022 by spending \u0022military funds with alacrity and generosity\u0022. He contrasted this with the situation faced by poor Americans, claiming that Congress had merely provided \u0022poverty funds with miserliness\u0022. His vision was for change that was more revolutionary than mere reform: he cited systematic flaws of \u0022racism, poverty, militarism and materialism\u0022, and argued that \u0022reconstruction of society itself is the real issue to be faced.\u0022\nThe Poor People\u0027s Campaign was controversial even within the civil rights movement. Rustin resigned from the march, stating that the goals of the campaign were too broad, that its demands were unrealizable, and that he thought that these campaigns would accelerate repression on the poor and the black.\n\n\n=== Global policy ===\nKing was one of the signatories of the agreement to convene a convention for drafting a world constitution. As a result, in 1968 a World Constituent Assembly convened to draft and adopt the Constitution for the Federation of Earth.\r\n\r\n== Assassination and aftermath ==\n\nOn March 29, 1968, King went to Memphis, Tennessee, in support of the black sanitation workers, who were represented by American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 1733. The workers had been on strike since March 12 for higher wages and better treatment. In one incident, black street repairmen received pay for two hours when they were sent home because of bad weather, but white employees were paid for the full day.\nOn April 3, King addressed a rally and delivered his \u0022I\u0027ve Been to the Mountaintop\u0022 address at Mason Temple. King\u0027s flight to Memphis had been delayed by a bomb threat against his plane. In reference to the bomb threat, King said:\n\nAnd then I got to Memphis. And some began to say the threats, or talk about the threats that were out. What would happen to me from some of our sick white brothers?\nWell, I don\u0027t know what will happen now. We\u0027ve got some difficult days ahead. But it doesn\u0027t matter with me now. Because I\u0027ve been to the mountaintop. And I don\u0027t mind. Like anybody, I would like to live a long life. Longevity has its place. But I\u0027m not concerned about that now. I just want to do God\u0027s will. And He\u0027s allowed me to go up to the mountain. And I\u0027ve looked over. And I\u0027ve seen the promised land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the promised land. So I\u0027m happy, tonight. I\u0027m not worried about anything. I\u0027m not fearing any man. Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord.\nKing was booked in Room 306 at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis. Ralph Abernathy, who was present at the assassination, testified to the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations that King and his entourage stayed at Room 306 so often that it was known as the \u0022King-Abernathy suite\u0022. According to Jesse Jackson, who was present, King\u0027s last words were spoken to musician Ben Branch, who was scheduled to perform that night at an event King was attending: \u0022Ben, make sure you play \u0027Take My Hand, Precious Lord\u0027 in the meeting tonight. Play it real pretty.\u0022\nKing was fatally shot by James Earl Ray at 6:01 p.m., Thursday, April 4, 1968, as he stood on the motel\u0027s second-floor balcony. The bullet entered through his right cheek, smashing his jaw, then traveled down his spinal cord before lodging in his shoulder. Abernathy heard the shot from inside the motel room and ran to the balcony to find King on the floor.\nAfter emergency surgery, King died at St. Joseph\u0027s Hospital at 7:05 p.m. According to biographer Taylor Branch, King\u0027s autopsy revealed that though only 39 years old, he \u0022had the heart of a 60 year old\u0022, which Branch attributed to stress. King was initially interred in South View Cemetery in South Atlanta, but in 1977, his remains were transferred to a tomb on the site of the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historical Park.\n\n\n=== Aftermath ===\n\nThe assassination led to race riots in Washington, D.C., Chicago, Baltimore, Louisville, Kansas City, and dozens of other cities. Presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy was on his way to Indianapolis for a campaign rally when he was informed of King\u0027s death. He gave a short, improvised speech to the gathering of supporters informing them of the tragedy and urging them to continue King\u0027s ideal of nonviolence. The following day, he delivered a prepared response in Cleveland. James Farmer Jr. and other civil rights leaders also called for non-violent action, while the more militant Stokely Carmichael called for a more forceful response. The city of Memphis quickly settled the strike on terms favorable to the sanitation workers.\nThe plan to set up a shantytown in Washington, D.C., was carried out soon after the April 4 assassination. Criticism of King\u0027s plan was subdued in the wake of his death, and the SCLC received an unprecedented wave of donations to carry it out. The campaign officially began in Memphis, on May 2, at the hotel where King was murdered. Thousands of demonstrators arrived on the National Mall and stayed for six weeks, establishing a camp they called \u0022Resurrection City\u0022.\nPresident Johnson tried to quell the riots by making telephone calls to civil rights leaders, mayors and governors and told politicians that they should warn the police against the unwarranted use of force. \u0022I\u0027m not getting through,\u0022 Johnson told his aides. \u0022They\u0027re all holing up like generals in a dugout getting ready to watch a war.\u0022 Johnson declared April 7 a national day of mourning for King. Vice President Hubert Humphrey attended King\u0027s funeral on behalf of the President, as there were fears that Johnson\u0027s presence might incite protests and perhaps violence. At his widow\u0027s request, King\u0027s last sermon at Ebenezer Baptist Church, given on February 4, 1968, was played at the funeral,\n\nI\u0027d like somebody to mention that day that Martin Luther King Jr. tried to give his life serving others. I\u0027d like for somebody to say that day that Martin Luther King Jr. tried to love somebody. I want you to say that day that I tried to be right on the war question. I want you to be able to say that day that I did try to feed the hungry. I want you to be able to say that day that I did try in my life to clothe those who were naked. I want you to say on that day that I did try in my life to visit those who were in prison. And I want you to say that I tried to love and serve humanity.\nYes, if you want to say that I was a drum major. Say that I was a drum major for justice. Say that I was a drum major for peace. I was a drum major for righteousness. And all of the other shallow things will not matter. I won\u0027t have any money to leave behind. I won\u0027t have the fine and luxurious things of life to leave behind. But I just want to leave a committed life behind.\nHis good friend Mahalia Jackson sang his favorite hymn, \u0022Take My Hand, Precious Lord\u0022, at the funeral. The assassination helped to spur the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1968. Two months after King\u0027s death, James Earl Ray\u2014on the loose from a previous prison escape\u2014was captured at London Heathrow Airport while trying to reach white-ruled Rhodesia on a false Canadian passport. He was using the alias Ramon George Sneyd. Ray was quickly extradited to Tennessee and charged with King\u0027s murder. He confessed on March 10, 1969, though he recanted this confession three days later. On the advice of his attorney Percy Foreman, Ray pleaded guilty to avoid the possibility of the death penalty. He was sentenced to a 99-year prison term. Ray later claimed a man he met in Montreal, Quebec, with the alias \u0022Raoul\u0022 was involved and that the assassination was the result of a conspiracy. He spent the remainder of his life attempting, unsuccessfully, to withdraw his guilty plea and secure the trial he never had. Ray died in 1998 at age 70.\n\n\n=== Allegations of conspiracy ===\n\nRay\u0027s lawyers maintained he was a scapegoat similar to the way that John F. Kennedy\u0027s assassin Lee Harvey Oswald is seen by conspiracy theorists. Supporters of this assertion said that Ray\u0027s confession was given under pressure and that he had been threatened with the death penalty. They admitted that Ray was a thief and burglar, but claimed that he had no record of committing violent crimes with a weapon. However, prison records in different U.S. cities have shown that he was incarcerated on numerous occasions for armed robbery. In a 2008 interview with CNN, Jerry Ray, the younger brother of James Earl Ray, claimed that James was smart and was sometimes able to get away with armed robbery. \u0022I never been with nobody as bold as he is,\u0022 Jerry said. \u0022He just walked in and put that gun on somebody, it was just like it\u0027s an everyday thing.\u0022\nThose suspecting a conspiracy point to the two successive ballistics tests which proved that a rifle similar to Ray\u0027s Remington Gamemaster had been the murder weapon. Those tests did not implicate Ray\u0027s specific rifle. Witnesses near King said that the shot came from another location, from behind thick shrubbery near the boarding house\u2014which had been cut away in the days following the assassination\u2014and not from the boarding house window. However, Ray\u0027s fingerprints were found on various objects in the bathroom where it was determined the gunfire came from. An examination of the rifle containing Ray\u0027s fingerprints determined that at least one shot was fired from the firearm at the time of the assassination.\nIn 1997, King\u0027s son Dexter Scott King met with Ray, and publicly supported Ray\u0027s efforts to obtain a new trial. Two years later, King\u0027s widow Coretta Scott King and the couple\u0027s children, represented by William F. Pepper, won a wrongful death claim against Loyd Jowers and \u0022other unknown co-conspirators\u0022. Jowers claimed to have received $100,000 to arrange King\u0027s assassination. The jury found Jowers to be complicit in a conspiracy and that government agencies were party to the assassination. \nIn 2000, the U.S. Department of Justice completed the investigation into Jowers\u0027 claims but did not find evidence of conspiracy. The investigation report recommended no further investigation unless new reliable facts are presented. A sister of Jowers admitted that he had fabricated the story so he could make $300,000 from selling the story, and she corroborated his story to get money to pay her income tax.\nIn 2002, The New York Times reported that a church minister, Ronald Denton Wilson, claimed his father, Henry Clay Wilson, assassinated King. He stated, \u0022It wasn\u0027t a racist thing; he thought Martin Luther King was connected with communism, and he wanted to get him out of the way.\u0022 Wilson provided no evidence to back up his claims.\nKing researchers David Garrow and Gerald Posner disagreed with Pepper\u0027s claims that the government killed King. In 2003, Pepper published a book about the investigation and trial, as well as his representation of James Earl Ray in his bid for a trial. James Bevel also disputed the argument that Ray acted alone, stating, \u0022There is no way a ten-cent white boy could develop a plan to kill a million-dollar black man.\u0022 In 2004, Jesse Jackson stated:\n\nThe fact is there were saboteurs to disrupt the march. And within our own organization, we found a very key person who was on the government payroll. So infiltration within, saboteurs from without and the press attacks. ... I will never believe that James Earl Ray had the motive, the money and the mobility to have done it himself. Our government was very involved in setting the stage for and I think the escape route for James Earl Ray.\nOn January 23 2025, President Donald Trump signed an Executive Order declassifying the records concerning the assassination.\r\n\r\n== Legacy ==\n\n\n=== South Africa ===\n\nKing\u0027s legacy includes influences on the Black Consciousness Movement and civil rights movement in South Africa. King\u0027s work was cited by, and served as, an inspiration for South African leader Albert Luthuli, who fought for racial justice in his country during apartheid and was later awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\n\nJohn Hume, the former leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, cited King\u0027s legacy as quintessential to the Northern Ireland civil rights movement and the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, calling him \u0022one of my great heroes of the century\u0022.\nThe Martin Luther King Fund and Foundation in the UK was set up as a charity on December 30, 1969, after King\u0027s assassination and following a visit to the UK in 1969 by his widow, Coretta King. The Foundation\u0027s first chairman, Canon John Collins, stated that the Foundation was to be an active UK national campaign for racial equality, its work also to include community projects in areas of social need, and education. International Personnel , an employment agency, was formed in 1970 out of the foundation\u0027s base in Balham, to find employment for professionally qualified black people. In its first year, the agency placed ten percent of its applicants in jobs equal to their ability. The Balham Training Scheme operated an evening school with lecturers in Typing, Shorthand, English and Math. The foundation was removed from the Charity Commission list on November 18, 1996, as it had ceased to exist.\nThe Northumbria and Newcastle Universities Martin Luther King Peace Committee still exists to honor King\u0027s legacy, as represented by his final visit to the UK to receive an honorary degree from Newcastle University in 1967. Northumbria and Newcastle remain centers for the study of Martin Luther King and the US civil rights movement. Inspired by King\u0027s vision, the committee undertakes a range of activities across the UK to \u0022build cultures of peace\u0022.\nIn 2017, Newcastle University unveiled a bronze statue of King to celebrate the 50th anniversary of his honorary doctorate ceremony. The Students Union also voted to rename their bar \u0022Luther\u0027s\u0022.\n\n\n=== United States ===\n\nKing has become a national icon in the history of American liberalism and American progressivism. His main legacy was to secure progress on civil rights in the U.S. Just days after King\u0027s assassination, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1968. Title VIII of the Act, commonly known as the Fair Housing Act, prohibited discrimination in housing and housing-related transactions on the basis of race, religion, or national origin . This legislation was seen as a tribute to King\u0027s struggle in his final years to combat residential discrimination. The day following King\u0027s assassination, teacher Jane Elliott conducted her first \u0022Blue Eyes/Brown Eyes\u0022 exercise with her class of elementary school students to help them understand King\u0027s death as it related to racism.\nKing\u0027s wife Coretta Scott King was active in matters of social justice and civil rights until her death in 2006. The same year that King was assassinated, she established the King Center in Atlanta, Georgia, dedicated to preserving his legacy and the work of championing nonviolent conflict resolution and tolerance worldwide. Their son, Dexter King, who died in 2024, served as the center\u0027s chairman until 2010. In 2010, Martin Luther King III became president. In 2012, King\u0027s youngest child, Bernice King, became the CEO. Daughter Yolanda King, who died in 2007, was a motivational speaker, author and founder of Higher Ground Productions, an organization specializing in diversity training.\nKing family members disagree about his views about LGBTQ people. King\u0027s widow Coretta said that she believed her husband would have supported them. However, King\u0027s youngest child, Bernice, said that he would have been opposed to gay marriage. King himself, in a 1958 advice column written for Ebony, called homosexuality a \u0022problem\u0022 and suggested that it could be resolved through psychiatric treatment.\n\n\n==== Martin Luther King Jr. Day ====\n\nBeginning in 1971, cities and states established annual holidays to honor King. On November 2, 1983, President Ronald Reagan signed a bill creating a federal holiday to honor King. Observed for the first time on January 20, 1986, it is called Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Following President George H. W. Bush\u0027s 1992 proclamation, the holiday is observed on the third Monday of January each year, near the time of King\u0027s birthday. On January 17, 2000, for the first time, Martin Luther King Jr. Day was officially observed in all fifty U.S. states. Arizona , New Hampshire and Utah were the last states to recognize the holiday. Utah previously celebrated the holiday under the name Human Rights Day.\r\n\r\n== Veneration ==\n\nKing was canonized by Archbishop Timothy Paul of the Holy Christian Orthodox Church on September 9, 2016. His feast day was set as April 4, the date of his assassination. King is also honored with a Lesser Feast on the liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church on April 4 or January 15, the anniversary of his birth. The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America commemorates King liturgically on January 15.\r\n\r\n== Ideas, influences, and political stances ==\n\n\n=== Christianity ===\n\nAs a Christian minister, King\u0027s main influence was Jesus Christ and the Christian gospels, which he would almost always quote in his speeches. King\u0027s faith was strongly based in the Golden Rule, loving God above all, and loving your enemies. His nonviolent thought was also based in the injunction to turn the other cheek in the Sermon on the Mount, and Jesus\u0027 teaching of putting the sword back into its place . In his Letter from Birmingham Jail, King urged action consistent with what he describes as Jesus\u0027 \u0022extremist\u0022 love, and also quoted numerous other Christian pacifist authors. In another sermon, he stated:\n\nBefore I was a civil rights leader, I was a preacher of the Gospel. This was my first calling and it still remains my greatest commitment. You know, actually all that I do in civil rights I do because I consider it a part of my ministry. I have no other ambitions in life but to achieve excellence in the Christian ministry. I don\u0027t plan to run for any political office. I don\u0027t plan to do anything but remain a preacher. And what I\u0027m doing in this struggle, along with many others, grows out of my feeling that the preacher must be concerned about the whole man.\nKing\u0027s private writings show that he rejected biblical literalism; he described the Bible as \u0022mythological\u0022, doubted that Jesus was born of a virgin and did not believe that the story of Jonah and the whale was true.\nAmong the thinkers who influenced King\u0027s theological outlook were L. Harold DeWolf, Edgar Brightman, Peter Bertocci, Walter George Muelder, Walter Rauschenbusch, and Reinhold Niebuhr.\n\n\n==== The Measure of a Man ====\nIn 1959, King published a short book called The Measure of a Man, which contained his sermons \u0022What is Man?\u0022 and \u0022The Dimensions of a Complete Life\u0022. The sermons argued for man\u0027s need for God\u0027s love and criticized the racial injustices of Western civilization.\n\n\n=== Nonviolence ===\n\nAfrican-American civil rights activist Bayard Rustin was King\u0027s first regular advisor on nonviolence. King was also advised by the white activists Harris Wofford and Glenn Smiley. Rustin and Smiley came from the Christian pacifist tradition, and Wofford and Rustin both studied Mahatma Gandhi\u0027s teachings. Rustin had applied nonviolence with the Journey of Reconciliation campaign in the 1940s, and Wofford had been promoting Gandhism to Southern blacks since the early 1950s.\nKing initially knew little about Gandhi and rarely used the term \u0022nonviolence\u0022 during his early activism. King initially believed in and practiced self-defense, even obtaining guns to defend against possible attackers. The pacifists showed him the alternative of nonviolent resistance, arguing that this would be a better means to accomplish his goals. King then vowed to no longer personally use arms.\nIn a chapter of Stride Toward Freedom, King outlined his understanding of nonviolence, which seeks to win an opponent to friendship, rather than to humiliate or defeat him. The chapter draws from an address by Wofford, with Rustin and Stanley Levison also providing guidance and ghostwriting.\nKing was inspired by Gandhi and his success with nonviolent activism, and as a theology student, King described Gandhi as being one of the \u0022individuals who greatly reveal the working of the Spirit of God\u0022. King had \u0022for a long time ... wanted to take a trip to India.\u0022 With assistance from Harris Wofford, the American Friends Service Committee, and other supporters, he was able to fund the journey in February 1959. The trip deepened his understanding of nonviolent resistance and his commitment to America\u0027s struggle for civil rights. In a radio address made during his final evening in India, King reflected, \u0022Since being in India, I am more convinced than ever before that the method of nonviolent resistance is the most potent weapon available to oppressed people in their struggle for justice and human dignity.\u0022\nWhen receiving the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, King hailed the \u0022successful precedent\u0022 of using nonviolence \u0022in a magnificent way by Mohandas K. Gandhi to challenge the might of the British Empire ... He struggled only with the weapons of truth, soul force, non-injury and courage.\u0022\nAnother influence for King\u0027s nonviolent method was Henry David Thoreau\u0027s essay On Civil Disobedience and its theme of refusing to cooperate with an evil system. He also was greatly influenced by the works of Protestant theologians Reinhold Niebuhr and Paul Tillich, and said that Walter Rauschenbusch\u0027s Christianity and the Social Crisis left an \u0022indelible imprint\u0022 on his thinking by giving him a theological grounding for his social concerns. King was moved by Rauschenbusch\u0027s vision of Christians spreading social unrest in \u0022perpetual but friendly conflict\u0022 with the state, simultaneously critiquing it and calling it to act as an instrument of justice. However, he was apparently unaware of the American tradition of Christian pacifism exemplified by Adin Ballou and William Lloyd Garrison. King frequently referred to Jesus\u0027 Sermon on the Mount as central for his work. Before 1960, King also sometimes used the concept of \u0022agape\u0022 .\nEven after renouncing personal use of guns, King had a complex relationship with self-defense in the movement. He publicly discouraged it as a widespread practice but acknowledged that it was sometimes necessary. Throughout his career King was frequently protected by other civil rights activists who carried arms, such as Colonel Stone Johnson, Robert Hayling, and the Deacons for Defense and Justice.\nAmid recurring riots in the mid-1960s, King reaffirmed his commitment to nonviolence. He stated that riots were \u0022the language of the unheard\u0022, the result of a failure to improve economic conditions and address racial injustice, but condemned them as \u0022self-defeating and socially destructive\u0022.\n\n\n=== Criticism within the movement ===\nKing was criticized by other black leaders in the civil rights movement. This included more militant thinkers such as Nation of Islam member Malcolm X. Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee founder Ella Baker regarded King as a charismatic media figure who lost touch with the grassroots of the movement as he became close to elite figures like Nelson Rockefeller. Stokely Carmichael, a protege of Baker\u0027s, became a black separatist and disagreed with King\u0027s plea for racial integration because he considered it an insult to a uniquely African-American culture. He also took issue that King\u0027s non-violence approach depended on appealing to America\u0027s conscience, feeling America had none to appeal to.\n\n\n=== Activism and involvement with Native Americans ===\nKing was an avid supporter of Native American rights and Native Americans were active supporters of King\u0027s civil rights movement. The Native American Rights Fund was patterned after the NAACP\u0027s Legal Defense and Education Fund. The National Indian Youth Council was especially supportive in King\u0027s campaigns especially the Poor People\u0027s Campaign in 1968. In King\u0027s book Why We Can\u0027t Wait he writes:\n\nOur nation was born in genocide when it embraced the doctrine that the original American, the Indian, was an inferior race. Even before there were large numbers of Negroes on our shores, the scar of racial hatred had already disfigured colonial society. From the sixteenth century forward, blood flowed in battles over racial supremacy. We are perhaps the only nation which tried as a matter of national policy to wipe out its indigenous population. Moreover, we elevated that tragic experience into a noble crusade. Indeed, even today we have not permitted ourselves to reject or to feel remorse for this shameful episode. Our literature, our films, our drama, our folklore all exalt it.\nIn the late 1950\u0027s, the remaining Creek in Alabama were trying to completely desegregate schools. Light-complexioned Native children were allowed to ride buses to previously all-white schools, while dark-skinned Native children from the same band were barred from the same buses. Tribal leaders, hearing of King\u0027s desegregation campaign in Birmingham, contacted him for assistance. Through his intervention the problem was quickly resolved.\nIn September 1959, after giving a speech at the University of Arizona on the ideals of using nonviolent methods in creating social change, King stated his belief that one must not use force in this struggle \u0022but match the violence of his opponents with his suffering.\u0022 King then went to Southside Presbyterian, a predominantly Native American church, and was fascinated by their photos; he wanted to go to an Indian Reservation to meet the people so Casper Glenn took King to the Papago Indian Reservation. He met with all the tribal leaders, visited another Presbyterian church near the reservation, and preached there, attracting a Native American crowd. He later returned to Old Pueblo in March 1962 where he preached again to a Native American congregation. King would continue to attract the attention of Native Americans throughout the civil rights movement. During the 1963 March on Washington there was a sizable Native American contingent, including many from South Dakota and from the Navajo nation.\nKing was a major inspiration, along with the civil rights movement, of the Native American rights movement of the 1960s and many of its leaders. John Echohawk, a member of the Pawnee tribe who was the executive director and a founder of the Native American Rights Fund, stated:\n\nInspired by Dr. King, who was advancing the civil rights agenda of equality under the laws of this country, we thought that we could also use the laws to advance our Indianship, to live as tribes in our territories governed by our own laws under the principles of tribal sovereignty that had been with us ever since 1831. We believed that we could fight for a policy of self-determination that was consistent with U.S. law and that we could govern our own affairs, define our own ways and continue to survive in this society.\n\n\n=== Politics ===\nAs the leader of the SCLC, King maintained a policy of not publicly endorsing a U.S. political party or candidate: \u0022I feel someone must remain in the position of non-alignment, so that he can look objectively at both parties and be the conscience of both\u2014not the servant or master of either.\u0022 In a 1958 interview, he expressed his view that neither party was perfect, saying, \u0022I don\u0027t think the Republican party is a party full of the almighty God nor is the Democratic party. They both have weaknesses ... And I\u0027m not inextricably bound to either party.\u0022 King did praise Democratic Senator Paul Douglas of Illinois as being the \u0022greatest of all senators\u0022 because of his fierce advocacy for civil rights causes.\nKing critiqued both parties\u0027 performance on promoting racial equality:\n\nActually, the Negro has been betrayed by both the Republican and the Democratic party. The Democrats have betrayed him by capitulating to the whims and caprices of the Southern Dixiecrats. The Republicans have betrayed him by capitulating to the blatant hypocrisy of reactionary right-wing northern Republicans. And this coalition of southern Dixiecrats and right-wing reactionary northern Republicans defeats every bill and every move towards liberal legislation in the area of civil rights.\nAlthough King never publicly supported a political party or candidate for president, in a letter to a civil rights supporter in October 1956 he said that he had not decided whether he would vote for Democrat Adlai Stevenson II or Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower at the 1956 presidential election, but that \u0022In the past, I always voted the Democratic ticket.\u0022 In his autobiography, King says that in 1960 he privately voted for Democratic candidate John F. Kennedy: \u0022I felt that Kennedy would make the best president. I never came out with an endorsement. My father did, but I never made one.\u0022 King adds that he likely would have made an exception to his non-endorsement policy for a second Kennedy term, saying \u0022Had President Kennedy lived, I would probably have endorsed him in 1964.\u0022\nIn 1964, King urged his supporters \u0022and all people of goodwill\u0022 to vote against Republican Senator Barry Goldwater for president, saying that his election \u0022would be a tragedy, and certainly suicidal almost, for the nation and the world.\u0022 King believed Robert F. Kennedy would make for a good president, but also believed that he wouldn\u0027t beat Johnson in the 1968 Democratic Party presidential primaries. He also expressed support for the possible presidential candidacies of Republicans Nelson Rockefeller, George Romney and Charles Percy.\nKing rejected both laissez-faire capitalism and communism; King had read Marx while at Morehouse but rejected communism because of its \u0022materialistic interpretation of history\u0022 that denied religion, its \u0022ethical relativism\u0022, and its \u0022political totalitarianism\u0022. He stated that one focused too much on the individual while the other focused too much on the collective.\nIn a 1952 letter to Coretta Scott, he said: \u0022I imagine you already know that I am much more socialistic in my economic theory than capitalistic ...\u0022 In one speech, he stated that \u0022something is wrong with capitalism\u0022 and said, \u0022There must be a better distribution of wealth, and maybe America must move toward a democratic socialism.\u0022 King further said that \u0022capitalism has outlived its usefulness\u0022 and \u0022failed to meet the needs of the masses\u0022.\nKing was critical of American culture saying \u0022when machines and computers, profit motives and property rights are considered more important than people, the giant triplets of racism, materialism and militarism are incapable of being conquered\u0022 and that America must undergo a \u0022radical revolution of values\u0022. King considered that in America \u0022the problem is that we all too often have socialism for the rich and rugged free enterprise capitalism for the poor\u0022.\n\n\n=== Compensation ===\n\nKing stated that black Americans, as well as other disadvantaged Americans, should be compensated for historical wrongs. In an interview conducted for Playboy in 1965, he said that granting black Americans only equality could not realistically close the economic gap between them and whites. King said that he did not seek a full restitution of wages lost to slavery, which he believed impossible, but proposed a government compensatory program of $50 billion over ten years to all disadvantaged groups.\nHe posited that \u0022the money spent would be more than amply justified by the benefits that would accrue to the nation through a spectacular decline in school dropouts, family breakups, crime rates, illegitimacy, swollen relief rolls, rioting and other social evils.\u0022 He presented this idea as an application of the common law regarding settlement of unpaid labor but clarified that he felt that the money should not be spent exclusively on blacks. He stated, \u0022It should benefit the disadvantaged of all races.\u0022\n\n\n=== Television ===\nActress Nichelle Nichols planned to leave the science-fiction television series Star Trek in 1967 after its first season. She changed her mind after talking to King, who was a fan of the show. King explained that her character signified a future of greater racial cooperation. King told Nichols, \u0022You are our image of where we\u0027re going, you\u0027re 300 years from now, and that means that\u0027s where we are and it takes place now. Keep doing what you\u0027re doing, you are our inspiration.\u0022 As Nichols recounted: Star Trek was one of the only shows that [King] and his wife Coretta would allow their little children to watch. And I thanked him and I told him I was leaving the show. All the smile came off his face. And he said, \u0027Don\u0027t you understand for the first time we\u0027re seen as we should be seen. You don\u0027t have a black role. You have an equal role.\u0027 The series\u0027 creator, Gene Roddenberry, was deeply moved upon learning of King\u0027s support.\r\n\r\n== State surveillance and coercion ==\n\n\n=== FBI surveillance and wiretapping ===\n\nFBI director J. Edgar Hoover personally ordered surveillance of King, with the intent to undermine his power as a civil rights leader. The Church Committee, a 1975 investigation by the U.S. Congress, found that \u0022From December 1963 until his death in 1968, Martin Luther King Jr. was the target of an intensive campaign by the Federal Bureau of Investigation to \u0027neutralize\u0027 him as an effective civil rights leader.\u0022\nIn the fall of 1963, the FBI received authorization from Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy to proceed with wiretapping of King\u0027s phone lines, purportedly due to his association with Stanley Levison. The Bureau informed President John F. Kennedy. He and his brother unsuccessfully tried to persuade King to dissociate himself from Levison, a New York lawyer who had been involved with Communist Party USA. Although Robert Kennedy only gave written approval for limited wiretapping of King\u0027s telephone lines \u0022on a trial basis, for a month or so\u0022, Hoover extended the clearance so his men were \u0022unshackled\u0022 to look for evidence in any areas of King\u0027s life they deemed worthy.\nThe Bureau placed wiretaps on the home and office phone lines of both Levison and King, and bugged King\u0027s rooms in hotels as he traveled across the country. In 1967, Hoover listed the SCLC as a black nationalist hate group, with the instructions: \u0022No opportunity should be missed to exploit through counterintelligence techniques the organizational and personal conflicts of the leaderships of the groups ... to insure  [sic] the targeted group is disrupted, ridiculed, or discredited.\u0022\n\n\n=== Police surveillance ===\nKing was also the subject of extensive surveillance by local police agencies throughout the United States. At the March on Washington, where King declared, \u0022We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality\u0022, undercover police from both the Birmingham Police Department and the Philadelphia Police Department were on hand to monitor the day\u0027s proceedings. Additional documented instances of local police that monitored King include the New York Police Department and the Chicago Police Department.\nThe Memphis Police Department also spied on King in the spring of 1968, as the civil rights leader was taking part in a campaign to support striking sanitation workers in the Tennessee city. A fire station was located across from the Lorraine Motel, next to the boarding house in which James Earl Ray was staying. Police officers were stationed in the fire station to keep King under surveillance. Agents were watching King at the time he was shot. Immediately following the shooting, officers rushed to the motel. Marrell McCollough, an undercover police officer, was the first person to administer first aid to King. The antagonism between King and the FBI, the lack of an all points bulletin to find the killer, and the police presence nearby led to speculation that the FBI was involved in the assassination.\n\n\n=== NSA monitoring of King\u0027s communications ===\nIn a secret operation code-named \u0022Minaret\u0022, the National Security Agency monitored the communications of leading Americans, including King, who were critical of the U.S. war in Vietnam. A review by the NSA itself concluded that Minaret was \u0022disreputable if not outright illegal\u0022.\n\n\n=== Allegations of communism ===\nFor years, Hoover had been suspicious of potential influence of communists in social movements such as labor unions and civil rights. Hoover directed the FBI to track King in 1957, and the SCLC when it was established.\nDue to the relationship between King and Stanley Levison, the FBI feared Levison was working as an \u0022agent of influence\u0022 over King, in spite of its own reports in 1963 that Levison had left the Party and was no longer associated in business dealings with them. Another King lieutenant, Jack O\u0027Dell, was also linked to the Communist Party by sworn testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee .\nDespite the extensive surveillance, by 1976 the FBI had acknowledged that it had not obtained any evidence that King himself or the SCLC were actually involved with any communist organizations.\nFor his part, King adamantly denied having any connections to communism. In a 1965 Playboy interview, he stated that \u0022there are as many Communists in this freedom movement as there are Eskimos in Florida.\u0022 He argued that Hoover was \u0022following the path of appeasement of political powers in the South\u0022 and that his concern for communist infiltration of the civil rights movement was meant to \u0022aid and abet the salacious claims of southern racists and the extreme right-wing elements.\u0022 Hoover replied by saying that King was \u0022the most notorious liar in the country\u0022. After his \u0022I Have A Dream\u0022 speech, the FBI described King as \u0022the most dangerous and effective Negro leader in the country\u0022. It alleged that he was \u0022knowingly, willingly and regularly cooperating with and taking guidance from communists.\u0022\nThe attempts to prove that King was a communist were related to the feeling of many segregationists that blacks in the South were content with the status quo but had been stirred up by \u0022communists\u0022 and \u0022outside agitators\u0022. King said that \u0022the Negro revolution is a genuine revolution, born from the same womb that produces all massive social upheavals\u2014the womb of intolerable conditions and unendurable situations.\u0022\n\n\n=== CIA surveillance ===\nCIA files declassified in 2017 revealed that the agency was investigating possible links between King and Communism after a Washington Post article dated November 4, 1964, claimed he was invited to the Soviet Union and that Ralph Abernathy, as spokesman for King, refused to comment on the source of the invitation. Mail belonging to King and other civil rights activists was intercepted by the CIA program HTLINGUAL.\n\n\n=== Allegations of adultery ===\n\nThe FBI attempted to discredit King through revelations regarding his private life. FBI surveillance, some of it since made public, attempted to demonstrate that he had extramarital affairs. The FBI distributed reports regarding such affairs to the executive branch, friendly reporters, potential coalition partners and funding sources of the SCLC, and King\u0027s family. The bureau sent anonymous letters to King threatening to reveal information about his affairs. The FBI\u2013King letter sent to King just before he received the Nobel Peace Prize read, in part:\n\nThe American public, the church organizations that have been helping\u2014Protestants, Catholics and Jews will know you for what you are\u2014an evil beast. So will others who have backed you. You are done. King, there is only one thing left for you to do. You know what it is. You have just 34 days in which to do . You are done. There is but one way out for you. You better take it before your filthy fraudulent self is bared to the nation.\nThe letter was accompanied by a tape recording\u2014excerpted from FBI wiretaps\u2014of several of King\u0027s extramarital liaisons. King interpreted this package as an attempt to drive him to suicide, although William Sullivan, then head of the Domestic Intelligence Division, argued it may have only been intended to \u0022convince Dr. King to resign from the SCLC.\u0022 Upon the release of the full letter in 2014, Yale history professor Beverly Gage noted in a New York Times article that the claim that the FBI \u0022simply meant to push King out, not induce suicide\u0022 was a possibility, pointing out that \u0022Another uncovered portion of the note praises \u0022older leaders\u0022 like the NAACP executive director Roy Wilkins, urging King to step aside and let other men lead the civil rights movement.\u0022 King refused to succumb to the FBI\u0027s threats.\nIn 1977, district court judge John Lewis Smith Jr. ordered the recorded audiotapes and written transcripts resulting from the FBI\u0027s electronic surveillance of King between 1963-68 to be sealed from public access in the National Archives until 2027.\nIn 2019, an FBI file emerged on which a handwritten note alleged that King \u0022looked on, laughed and offered advice\u0022 as one of his friends raped a woman. Historians who have examined this notional evidence have dismissed it as highly unreliable. David Garrow, a King biographer, wrote that \u0022the suggestion ... that he either actively tolerated or personally employed violence against any woman, even while drunk, poses so fundamental a challenge to his historical stature as to require the most complete and extensive historical review possible\u0022. Garrow\u0027s reliance on a handwritten note appended to a typed report is considered poor scholarship by other authorities. The professor of American studies at the University of Nottingham, Peter Ling, pointed out that Garrow was excessively credulous, if not naive, in accepting the accuracy of FBI reports during a period when it was undertaking an operation to attempt to discredit King. Professors Jeanne Theoharis, Barbara Ransby, Nathan Connolly and Glenda Gilmore have expressed reservations about Garrow\u0027s scholarship. Theoharis commented \u0022Most scholars I know would penalize graduate students for doing this.\u0022 It is not the first time the rigor of Garrow\u0027s work has been called into serious question. Clayborne Carson, King biographer and overseer of the Dr. King records at Stanford University states that he came to the opposite conclusion of Garrow:\n\nNone of this is new. Garrow is talking about a recently added summary of a transcript of a 1964 recording from the Willard Hotel that others, including Mrs. King, have said they did not hear Martin\u0027s voice on it. The added summary was four layers removed from the actual recording. This supposedly new information comes from an anonymous source in a single paragraph in an FBI report. You have to ask how could anyone conclude King looked at a rape from an audio recording in a room where he was not present. The tapes that could confirm or refute the allegation are scheduled to be declassified in 2027.\nIn his 1989 autobiography And the Walls Came Tumbling Down, Ralph Abernathy stated that King had a \u0022weakness for women\u0022, although they \u0022all understood and believed in the biblical prohibition against sex outside of marriage. It was just that he had a particularly difficult time with that temptation.\u0022 In a later interview, Abernathy said he only wrote the term \u0022womanizing\u0022, that he did not specifically say King had extramarital sex and that the infidelities were emotional rather than sexual. Abernathy criticized the media for sensationalizing the statements he wrote about King\u0027s affairs, such as the allegation King had a sexual affair the night before he was assassinated. In his 1986 book Bearing the Cross, Garrow wrote about affairs, including one woman King saw almost daily. According to Garrow, \u0022that relationship ... increasingly became the emotional centerpiece of King\u0027s life, but it did not eliminate the incidental couplings ... of King\u0027s travels.\u0022 He alleged that King explained his affairs as \u0022a form of anxiety reduction\u0022. Garrow asserted that King\u0027s supposed promiscuity caused him \u0022painful and at times overwhelming guilt\u0022. King\u0027s wife Coretta appeared to have accepted his affairs with equanimity, saying once that \u0022all that other business just doesn\u0027t have a place in the very high-level relationship we enjoyed.\u0022 Shortly after Bearing the Cross was released, civil rights author Howell Raines gave the book a positive review but opined that Garrow\u0027s allegations about King\u0027s sex life were \u0022sensational\u0022 and stated that Garrow was \u0022amassing facts rather than analyzing them\u0022.\r\n\r\n== Awards and recognition ==\n\nKing was awarded at least fifty honorary degrees from colleges and universities. On October 14, 1964, King became the youngest winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, which was awarded to him for leading nonviolent resistance to racial prejudice in the U.S. In 1965, he was awarded the American Liberties Medallion by the American Jewish Committee for his \u0022exceptional advancement of the principles of human liberty.\u0022 In his acceptance remarks, King said, \u0022Freedom is one thing. You have it all or you are not free.\u0022\nIn 1957, he was awarded the Spingarn Medal from the NAACP. Two years later, he won the Anisfield-Wolf Book Award for Stride Toward Freedom: The Montgomery Story. In 1966, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America awarded King the Margaret Sanger Award for \u0022his courageous resistance to bigotry and his lifelong dedication to the advancement of social justice and human dignity.\u0022 Also in 1966, King was elected as a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In November 1967, he made a 24-hour trip to the UK to receive an honorary Doctorate in Civil Law from Newcastle University, becoming the first African American the institution had recognized in this way. In an impromptu acceptance speech, he said:\n\nThere are three urgent and indeed great problems that we face not only in the United States of America but all over the world today. That is the problem of racism, the problem of poverty and the problem of war.\n\nIn addition to his nominations for three Grammy Awards, King posthumously won for Best Spoken Word Recording in 1971 for \u0022Why I Oppose The War In Vietnam\u0022.\nIn 1977, President Jimmy Carter posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to King. The citation read:\n\nMartin Luther King Jr. was the conscience of his generation. He gazed upon the great wall of segregation and saw that the power of love could bring it down. From the pain and exhaustion of his fight to fulfill the promises of our founding fathers for our humblest citizens, he wrung his eloquent statement of his dream for America. He made our nation stronger because he made it better. His dream sustains us yet.\nKing and his wife were also awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in 2004.\nKing was second in Gallup\u0027s List of Most Widely Admired People of the 20th Century. In 1963, he was named Time Person of the Year, and, in 2000, he was voted sixth in an online \u0022Person of the Century\u0022 poll by the same magazine. King placed third in The Greatest American conducted by the Discovery Channel and AOL.\n\n\n=== Five-dollar bill ===\nOn April 20, 2016, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew announced that the $5, $10, and $20 bills would all undergo redesign prior to 2020. Lew said that while Lincoln would remain on the front of the $5 bill, the reverse would be redesigned to depict various historical events that had occurred at the Lincoln Memorial. Among the planned designs are images from King\u0027s \u0022I Have a Dream\u0022 speech.\n\n\n=== Memorials ===\n\nMany memorial sites, buildings and sculptures have been created to honor Martin Luther King Jr, including the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library in Washington, D.C., the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Library in San Jose, California, and the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial in West Potomac Park next to the National Mall in Washington, D.C.\n\n\n=== Honorary doctorates ===\nKing has received several honorary doctorates.\n\n1957: Doctor of Humane Letters, Morehouse College; Doctor of Laws, Howard University; Doctor of Divinity, Chicago Theological Seminary\n1958: Doctor of Laws, Morgan State College; Doctor of Humanities, Central State College\n1959: Doctor of Divinity, Boston University\n1961: Doctor of Laws, Lincoln University; Doctor of Laws, University of Bridgeport\n1962: Doctor of Civil Laws, Bard College\n1963: Doctor of Letters, Keuka College\n1964: Doctor of Divinity, Wesleyan College; Doctor of Laws, Jewish Theological Seminary; Doctor of Laws, Yale University; Doctor of Divinity, Springfield College\n1965: Doctor of Laws, Hofstra University; Doctor of Humane Letters, Oberlin College; Doctor of Social Science, Amsterdam Free University; Doctor of Divinity, St. Peter\u0027s College\n1967: Doctor of Civil Law, University of Newcastle upon Tyne; Doctor of Laws, Grinnell College\r\n\r\n== Works ==\nStride Toward Freedom: The Montgomery Story ISBN 978-0-06-250490-6\nThe Measure of a Man ISBN 978-0-8006-0877-4\nStrength to Love ISBN 978-0-8006-9740-2\nWhy We Can\u0027t Wait ISBN 978-0-8070-0112-7\nWhere Do We Go from Here: Chaos or Community?
