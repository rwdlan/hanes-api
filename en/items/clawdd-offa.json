The structure did not represent a mutually agreed boundary between the Mercians and the Kingdom of Powys. It had a ditch on the Welsh side, with the displaced soil piled into a bank on the Mercian side. This suggests that Mercians constructed it as a defensive earthwork, or to demonstrate the power and intent of their kingdom.\nThroughout its entire length, the dyke provides an uninterrupted view from Mercia into Wales. Where the earthwork encounters hills or high ground, it passes to the west of them.\nAlthough historians often overlook Offa\u0027s reign because of limitations in source material, he ranks as one of the greatest Anglo-Saxon rulers \u2013 as evidenced in his ability to raise the workforce and resources required to construct the dyke. Those requirements were immense \u2013 when Michael Wood approached motorway contractors in the late 1970s regarding potential costs in present terms they \u0022threw up their hands in dismay... impossible, they said.\u0022 The construction of the earthwork probably involved a corv\u00E9e system requiring vassals to build certain lengths of the earthwork for Offa in addition to performing their normal services to their king. The Tribal Hidage, a primary document, shows the distribution of land within 8th-century Britain; it shows that peoples were located within specified territories for administration.\n\n\n=== Early scholarship ===\n\nThe first historians and archaeologists to examine the dyke compared their conclusions with the late 9th-century writer Asser, who wrote, \u0022there was in Mercia in fairly recent time a certain vigorous king called Offa, who terrified all the neighbouring kings and provinces around him, and who had a great dyke built between Wales and Mercia from sea to sea\u0022. In 1955, Cyril Fox published the first major survey of the dyke. He concurred with Asser that the earthwork ran \u0027from sea to sea\u0027, theorising that the dyke ran from the River Dee estuary in the north to the River Wye in the south: approximately 150 miles . Although Fox observed that Offa\u0027s Dyke was not a continuous linear structure, he concluded that earthworks were raised in only those areas where natural barriers did not already exist.\nHistorian Frank Stenton accepts Fox\u0027s conclusions. He wrote the introduction to Fox\u0027s account of the dyke. Although Fox\u0027s work has now been revised to some extent, it still remains a vital record of some stretches of Offa\u0027s Dyke that still existed between 1926 and 1928, when his three field surveys took place, but have since been destroyed.\n\n\n=== Later research ===\nIn 1978, Dr. Frank Noble challenged some of Fox\u0027s conclusions, stirring up new academic interest in Offa\u0027s Dyke. His thesis entitled \u0022Offa\u0027s Dyke Reviewed\u0022 raises several questions concerning the accepted historiography of Offa\u0027s Dyke. Noble postulates that the gaps in the Dyke were not the incorporation of natural features as defensive barriers, but instead the gaps were a \u0022ridden boundary\u0022, perhaps incorporating palisades, that left no archaeological trace. Noble also helped establish the Offa\u0027s Dyke Association, which maintains the Offa\u0027s Dyke Path. This long-distance footpath mostly follows the route of the dyke and is a designated British National Trail.\nJohn Davies writes of Fox\u0027s study: \u0022In the planning of it, there was a degree of consultation with the kings of Powys and Gwent. On the Long Mountain near Trelystan, the dyke veers to the east, leaving the fertile slopes in the hands of the Welsh; near Rhiwabon, it was designed to ensure that Cadell ap Brochwel retained possession of the Fortress of Penygadden.\u0022 And for Gwent, Offa had the dyke built \u0022on the eastern crest of the gorge, clearly with the intention of recognizing that the River Wye and its traffic belonged to the kingdom of Gwent\u0022.\nOngoing research and archaeology on Offa\u0027s Dyke has been undertaken for many years by the Extra-Mural Department of the University of Manchester. Interviews with Dr. David Hill, broadcast in episode 1 of In Search of the Dark Ages , show support for Noble\u0027s idea. Most recently, Hill and Margaret Worthington have undertaken considerable research on the dyke. Their work, though far from finished, has demonstrated that there is little evidence for the dyke stretching from sea to sea. Rather, they claim that it is a shorter structure stretching from Rushock Hill north of the Herefordshire Plain to Llanfynydd, near Mold, Flintshire, some 64 miles . According to Hill and Worthington, dykes in the far north and south may have different dates, and though they may be connected with Offa\u0027s Dyke, there is as yet no compelling evidence behind this.\n\n\n=== Contrary evidence ===\n\u0022Ofer\u0022 means \u0022border\u0022 or \u0022edge\u0022 in Old English, giving rise to the possibility of alternative derivations for some border features associated with Offa. Roman historian Eutropius in his book Historiae Romanae Breviarium, written around 369, mentions the Wall of Severus, a structure built by Septimius Severus, who was Roman Emperor between 193 and 211:\nNovissimum bellum in Britannia habuit, utque receptas provincias omni securitate muniret, vallum per CXXXIII passuum milia a mari ad mare deduxit. Decessit Eboraci admodum senex, imperii anno sexto decimo, mense tertio. Historiae Romanae Breviarium, viii 19.1\n\nHe had his most recent war in Britain, and to fortify the conquered provinces with all security, he built a wall for 133 miles from sea to sea. He died at York, a reasonably old man, in the sixteenth year and third month of his reign.\n\nThis source is conventionally thought to be referring, in error, to either Hadrian\u0027s Wall, 73 miles , or the Antonine Wall, 37 miles , which were both shorter and built in the 2nd century. Recently, some writers have suggested that Eutropius may have been referring to the earthwork later called Offa\u0027s Dyke. Most archaeologists reject this theory.\nBede also mentions the barrier built by Septimus Severus, but Bede says that the rampart was made of earth and timber, a description which would closer match Offa\u0027s Dyke than Hadrian\u0027s Wall, though it would describe the Antonine Wall:\n\nAfter many great and severe battles, thought fit to divide that part of the island, which he had recovered, from the other unconquered nations, not with a wall, as some imagine, but with a rampart. For a wall is made of stones, but a rampart, with which camps are fortified to repel the assaults of enemies, is made of sods, cut out of the earth, and raised high above the ground, like a wall, having in front of it the trench whence the sods were taken, with strong stakes of wood fixed above it. Thus Severus drew a great trench and strong rampart, fortified with several towers, from sea to sea. Bede\u0027s Ecclesiastical History of England, Bk 1-5\n\nHowever, the solution to the problem lies a few chapters later in Bede\u0027s account. In Book One Chapter Twelve of Bede\u0027s Ecclesiastical History, he writes that the Romans \u0022built a strong wall of stone directly from sea to sea in a straight line between the towns that had been built as strong-points, where Severus had built his earthwork ... straight from east to west\u0022. The strong wall of stone cannot refer to the Antonine Wall or Offa\u0027s Dyke, so it clearly refers to Hadrian\u0027s Wall, especially as Offa\u0027s Dyke runs from north to south. Also, as Severus\u0027s earthwork is described as being in the same location as Hadrian\u0027s Wall, it cannot be Offa\u0027s Dyke either, so the earth rampart with a great trench that Bede refers to must be the Vallum, the adjoining earthen barrier immediately south of Hadrian\u0027s Wall. Bede inadvertently attributes the Vallum to Septimius Severus, saying that it predated the wall. In fact the Vallum was the work of Hadrian and slightly post-dated the wall.\nEvidence has also been found that challenges the accepted date of the construction of Offa\u0027s Dyke. In December 1999, Shropshire County Council archaeologists uncovered the remains of a hearth or fire on the original ground surface beneath Wat\u0027s Dyke near Oswestry. Carbon dating analysis of the burnt charcoal and burnt clay in situ showed it was covered by earth around 446. Archaeologists concluded that this part of Wat\u0027s Dyke, so long thought of as Anglo-Saxon and a mid-8th-century contemporary of Offa\u0027s Dyke, was built 300 years earlier in the post-Roman period.\nIn 2014, excavations by the Clwyd-Powys Archaeological Trust focused on nine samples of the dyke near Chirk. Radiocarbon dating of redeposited turf resulted in a series of dates. In one section, these ranged from 430 to 652 and in another section from 887 to 1019: confirming that the bank is clearly post-Roman and that at least some rebuilding work took place after Offa\u0027s reign. It has been suggested that Offa\u0027s Dyke may have been a long-term project by several Mercian kings. Further excavations on the dyke at Chirk Castle found well-preserved remains of the ditch under later parkland; radiocarbon samples were recovered, but the results have not yet been made public.\r\n\r\n== Current ==\nThe England\u2013Wales border still mostly passes within a few miles of the course of Offa\u0027s Dyke through the Welsh Marches. The dyke has a cultural significance, symbolising the separation between England and Wales, similar to Hadrian\u0027s Wall between England and Scotland in the Scottish Marches. George Borrow, in his Wild Wales , drawn from folklore, claimed that:\n[It] was customary for the English to cut off the ears of every Welshman who was found to the east of the dyke, and for the Welsh to hang every Englishman whom they found to the west of it.A three-mile section of the dyke which overlooks Tintern Abbey and includes the Devil\u0027s Pulpit near Chepstow is now managed by English Heritage. All sections of Offa\u0027s Dyke that survive as visible earthworks, or as infilled but undeveloped ditch, are designated as a scheduled monument. However, some parts of the dyke may also remain buried under later development. Some sections are also defined as Sites of Special Scientific Interest, including stretches within the Lower Wye Valley SSSI and the Highbury Wood National Nature Reserve. Parts are located within the Wye Valley and Shropshire Hills Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty.  Most of the line of Offa\u0027s Dyke is designated as a public right of way, including those sections which form part of the Offa\u0027s Dyke Path.\nIn August 2013, a 45-metre section of dyke, between Chirk and Llangollen, was destroyed by a local landowner. The destruction of the dyke to build a stable was said to be like \u0022driving a road through Stonehenge\u0022, but the perpetrator escaped punishment.\nThe Offa\u0027s Dyke Centre is a purpose-built information centre in the town of Knighton, on Offa\u0027s Dyke on the border between England and Wales . Some of the best remains of the earthworks can be seen within a two-minute walk from the centre. The Offa\u0027s Dyke Path is a long-distance footpath close to the England\u2013Wales border.  Although large sections are close to the dyke, the path is longer and in some places passes at some distance from the earthworks. Opened in 1971, the path is one of Britain\u0027s longest national trails, stretching for 283 km from the Severn estuary at Sedbury, near Chepstow, to Prestatyn on the north Wales coast.",
